                **Ry-Guy Reacts to Jason Aaron’s “Creative Compromise” on ‘Star Wars’ Comics—With a Side of Frozen Doughnuts in Mukwonago, Wisconsin.**  

So Jason Aaron spilled the beans about his "handcuffed masterpiece" for *Star Wars* comics. Yeah, that’s what he called it: creative restrictions so tight they’d make Kylo Ren jealous (or laugh until his helmet fogs up). Turns out Lucasfilm wouldn’t let him “mess with canon,” as if we all bought into the idea of a single, sacred timeline anyway? I mean, come on—we’re talking about a universe where Jar-Jar Binks was once considered deep lore. Aaron’s whining like he got denied access to the Death Star blueprints… but for comics! As my editor said: “At least they didn’t make you write a ‘prequel-era’ issue with more dialogue than an Ewok funeral.”  

Meanwhile, in Mukwonago (where snowflakes are falling harder than George Lucas’s reputation), I’m stuck reviewing the latest Dairyland Doughnut Shop seasonal special—“Frozen Tundra Sprinkle Swirl” or something. It tastes like a blizzard made of regret and maple syrup gone wrong. But hey, at least this town hasn’t banned me from writing about its weather yet… unlike Lucasfilm banning Aaron’s “non-canonical ideas.”  

Aaron claims he’ll still deliver an epic saga with these chains on his wrists—*cough*, the guy who wrote Thor vs. Hulk while sipping whiskey in a bunker knows how to spin yarns even when grounded*. But let me tell you: if I had creative restrictions this suffocating, my comic book would be titled *“The Saga of Ry-Guy’s First Draft That Got Shredded by Mukwonago’s Wind Chill.”*  

Bottom line? Aaron sold his soul for a paycheck and the chance to say he “touched” Star Wars. Meanwhile, real art gets made in garages (and doughnut shops) where nobody cares if you follow canon—they just want something that doesn’t taste like frozen sludge by February.*
