They have a shot to make it four tonight against the Orlando Magic. However, each of those previous wins came against poor opponents, and now they face a greater challenge with the Magic, even without Franz Wagner. This game will be a good indicator of where the Bucks are as they navigate life without Giannis. It's time for a real test!

After beating up on some bad opponents, the Bucks battle with a playoff team tonight against Orlando in what should be their toughest matchup yet. Milwaukee's offense has been firing on all cylinders recently, but their defense could still use some work and that will likely be put to the test against the Magic. Ryan Rollins has looked back to his damaging self, while Kevin Porter Jr. has also been stuffing the stat sheet since returning from injury. Meanwhile, Orlando has been relatively disappointing this year despite making an all-in trade for Desmond Bane in the offseason. The Magic have beaten some teams that don't plan on winning another game this year and are currently sitting at a middling 15th place in terms of defense—far below last season's second-place finish.

Injuries will play a role tonight as Giannis Antetokounmpo (calf) and Taurean Prince (neck) are both out for the Bucks, while Franz Wagner (ankle) is out for Orlando. With that in mind, it'll be interesting to see how Cam Thomas impacts the rhythm of Rollins and Porter since he's signed with Milwaukee recently but won't play tonight against his former team.

A player to watch for this game will undoubtedly be Anthony Black who has taken a giant leap this season after an iffy first few years in league. He plays a crucial role as connector and two-way player, so keeping him contained might be key for the Bucks' success tonight.

Ry-Guy's Betting Lock:
The Magic are playing at home without Franz Wagner but still managed to win against both Nets and Jazz last games – which doesn't mean much given those teams don’t plan on winning another game this year. However, with the Magic’s defense currently sitting at a middling 15th place in terms of efficiency and their offensive rating also not being great (21st), they may struggle to contain Milwaukee's high-powered offense tonight despite losing Giannis.

The spread for this matchup is Milwaukee -8 points on FanDuel Sportsbook with an over/under set at 239.5 points which means there should be plenty of scoring between these two teams! Given that both teams have had issues defensively so far this season, I'm leaning towards the over here as well since neither team seems too concerned about stopping their opponent's offense yet. However, given how strong Milwaukee has been lately compared to Orlando’s recent performance against lowly opponents, I would still take the Bucks to cover the spread at -8 points tonight even without Giannis.
