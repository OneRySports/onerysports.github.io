It's unfortunate to see such an accomplished athlete go down with an ACL tear, and being air-lifted away from a crash scene only adds to the severity of her situation. This type of injury can be devastating for any professional athlete, let alone one as successful as Vonn has been over the course of her career.

Despite my respect for the sport and athletes like Vonn, I do have an analytical eye when it comes to betting on sports events. The question is whether this injury could affect the odds or spreads in any upcoming skiing competitions she may be involved with down the line. Unfortunately, without more specific information about the extent of her ACL tear and how long recovery will take, it's difficult to make a definitive statement on that front at this time.

However, from my experience as both a referee and sharp bettor, I know that injuries can certainly play a role in determining outcomes when it comes to betting on sporting events. Injuries can cause teams or individuals to be underdogs despite their usual performance records; conversely they might also lead some people overvalue those same teams or individuals if the injury is perceived as less serious than it actually is.

That being said, there are still plenty of other factors that come into play when determining value in sports betting situations - everything from weather conditions and course layouts to individual skill levels and team dynamics can all influence how a game will play out. 

In conclusion, while Lindsey Vonn's recent injury certainly deserves attention given her level of success within the sport, it remains too early to say definitively what impact this particular incident could have on future betting lines or spreads related to skiing competitions she may participate in down the line. As with any sports event where injuries are involved, we'll need more information before making definitive statements about how these types of setbacks might affect odds and payouts over time.
