The Wolves have been struggling in recent weeks and have been unable to shake off the feeling that something is missing from their game on both ends of the floor.

The team has made several moves during the break, including trading for All-Star forward Jimmy Butler, hoping that his presence will help spark the team back into championship contention. However, it remains to be seen whether or not these changes will have an immediate impact. The Timberwolves' head coach Tom Thibodeau is likely feeling the pressure as he tries to figure out how best to utilize his new roster and get this team playing at their peak performance levels once again.

One thing that has been consistent throughout the season, even with their recent struggles, is the Wolves' ability to keep games close. They have shown resilience in many of these tight contests but have fallen short when it comes down to making crucial plays in crunch time situations. This issue needs to be addressed if they want any chance at turning things around and contending for a playoff spot.

In order to do that, the Wolves will need their stars like Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins to step up on both ends of the floor while also relying heavily upon role players such as Robert Covington who has been one of Minnesota's most consistent performers this season despite injuries sidelining him for several games.

The upcoming matchup against Atlanta presents an opportunity for Thibodeau and his coaching staff to evaluate where things stand with their current roster configuration before diving headfirst into the second half of the regular season. The Hawks are coming off a disappointing loss to Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night, dropping them down 29-31 overall but still maintaining playoff aspirations despite having lost key players like John Collins earlier this week due to injury concerns regarding his ankle sprain suffered against Detroit Pistons last Friday evening.

With both teams looking for wins heading into the break, expect a competitive game between two clubs fighting for postseason berths in what could potentially turn out to be one of those "must-win" matchups that define entire seasons at times like these when everything seems uncertain about which direction your club is headed toward before making any final decisions regarding player transactions and/or roster moves.
