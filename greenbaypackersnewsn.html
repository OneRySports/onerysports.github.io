As much as we'd love to see the Pack win another Lombardi Trophy this season, we'll just have to wait until Super Bowl LXI comes around on Valentine's Day - which is the perfect day for a guy named Love to bring home a ring!

In the meantime, it looks like all of the major coaching changes are now set in stone. Ed Policy published his monthly Q&A over the weekend and explained why he wanted to keep Matt LaFleur as the Packers' head coach, praising LaFleur's success in wins as well as his ability to develop players. It'll be interesting to see how Love continues to ascend with LaFleur at the helm - if they can get a complete and healthy team around him, anything is possible!

As we start ramping up for free agency and next season, one name that's been popping up quite a bit lately is Romeo Doubs. While it would be nice to have him back in Green Bay, I'm not holding my breath - once he sees the kind of money he can likely sign for elsewhere, that door will slam shut pretty quickly!

Looking back at some of Packers' greatest teams from past Super Bowls, there's no denying who should top any all-time list: Bart Starr over Aaron Rodgers is definitely the right choice in my opinion. We've had some incredible players come through Lambeau Field over the years and it'll be exciting to see what kind of legacy Love can build here!
