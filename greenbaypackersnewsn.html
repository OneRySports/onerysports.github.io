The Green Bay Packers’ offseason has officially kicked off with most of the coaching changes complete, but one big thing needed to happen before everything could be set in stone. That’s the Super Bowl, which wrapped up the season on Sunday night with a 29-13 Seattle Seahawks victory over the New England Patriots.
All eyes now shift to next February as the race to Super Bowl LXI begins. The Seahawks went wire-to-wire as one of the NFL’s best teams and were easily one of the most complete as well. Sam Darnold is a Super Bowl-winning starting quarterback, but it was the Seahawks’ defense that really stole the show on Sunday evening as they never let Drake Maye and the Pats’ offense get into a rhythm.
Now the Packers and the NFL as a whole shift their focus to preparing for next year’s Super Bowl, which is a little over a year away. Next year’s game will take place on Valentine’s Day – a perfect time for someone named Love to win a ring, wouldn’t you say?
In the first curds of the true offseason, we find the new Packers president explaining why he extended the head coach, a look back at Packers Super Bowls past, and the start of some rumblings about free agency. Enjoy!

Ed Policy published his monthly Q&A over the weekend and addressed why he wanted to keep Matt LaFleur as the Packers’ head coach, praising LaFleur’s success in wins as well as his ability to develop players.
Jordan Love’s ascension should continue with Matt LaFleur | Packersnews.com
Indeed, LaFleur’s ability to develop quarterbacks is something you don’t just find anywhere. The next step for Love is to ascend into that truly elite tier of QBs and to find some sustained playoff success – though having a complete and healthy team around him would be a big help.
Report: ‘Door isn’t closed’ on WR Romeo Doubs returning to Packers | Packers Wire
I’m betting that door slams shut very quickly as soon as Doubs sees the money he can likely sign for elsewhere.
Ranking every Super Bowl champion team from 1-60 | ESPN
The Seahawks lost three games by a total of nine points this year, and according to DVOA they actually are one of the three best Super Bowl champions of all time. The Packers’ best title team is, unsurprisingly, the 1996 squad, which ranks fifth.

I might quibble with a few of these choices, but on the whole it seems right. Bart Starr over Aaron Rodgers is the right choice, in my opinion.
