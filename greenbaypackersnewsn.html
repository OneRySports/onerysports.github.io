They're a symbol of our state's pride and heritage. And as we look back at their history, there is no greater example of this than the 1929 NFL Championship win. That season proved that Wisconsin was the center of the football world before the playoffs even existed.

But let's fast forward to today - with the Super Bowl now in the rearview mirror and the offseason officially underway for the Green Bay Packers, it's time to turn our attention to what lies ahead. The race to Super Bowl LXI has begun, and while there are still a lot of unknowns at this point, one thing is clear: Matt LaFleur will continue to be at the helm of the team as their head coach.

Ed Policy addressed why he wanted to keep LaFleur on board in his monthly Q&A over the weekend. He praised LaFleur's success both in terms of wins and his ability to develop players, which is something you don't find just anywhere. And with Jordan Love at quarterback, there's no doubt that LaFleur will have another opportunity to showcase his coaching abilities.

Of course, there are still plenty of questions surrounding the team as they head into free agency. Will Romeo Doubs return? Who else will come and go during this offseason? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: with a complete and healthy roster around him, Love has what it takes to ascend into that truly elite tier of quarterbacks.

As we look back at the Packers' Super Bowl history, there's no denying the success they've had over the years. And while Bart Starr may have been chosen as the best quarterback in their Super Bowl history, I'd argue that Aaron Rodgers deserves his fair share of praise too. 

In any case, it's exciting to see what this new chapter will bring for the Green Bay Packers. With an eye on next year's Super Bowl and Valentine's Day fast approaching (a perfect time for someone named Love to win a ring!), there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the future of this iconic franchise from Wisconsin.
