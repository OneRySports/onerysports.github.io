The Seahawks emerged victorious in a 29-13 win over the New England Patriots, capping off an impressive season for Seattle. With the game out of the way, all eyes turn to next year's Super Bowl, which will take place on Valentine's Day – a fitting date for someone named Love to potentially win a ring.

The Packers' coaching changes are mostly complete, but one key figure remains: head coach Matt LaFleur. In his monthly Q&A, new president Ed Policy explained why he extended LaFleur's contract, praising his success in wins and ability to develop players – particularly quarterbacks. This is important for Jordan Love's continued growth as a player.

As the offseason progresses, there will be plenty of speculation about free agency, especially regarding wide receiver Romeo Doubs. While reports suggest that Doubs could return to Green Bay, it's likely he'll seek better financial terms elsewhere. Meanwhile, fans can look back on some of the Packers' best Super Bowl teams from past seasons, with the 1996 squad ranking fifth in ESPN's all-time rankings and Bart Starr being chosen over Aaron Rodgers for All-Packers All-Super Bowl Team honors.

As we wait to see what happens next for the Packers, let's remember some historical moments in team history – like when they wore jerseys with "ACME PACKERS" on them back in 1921 after acquiring sponsorship from Acme Packing Company. And while that may seem trivial compared to Don Majkowski’s ankle injury in 1992 (which many consider the most important injury in Wisconsin sports history), it's always good to appreciate our team's rich and storied past as we look ahead towards what promises to be another exciting year of Packers football.
