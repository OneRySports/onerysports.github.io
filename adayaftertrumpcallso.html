Chloe Kim's gotta be one of the toughest competitors I've seen since CC Sabathia pitched that complete game on short rest to clinch a Wild Card for the Brewers. That kid is all heart, just like our boy CC was out there in '08.

Here she is representing Team USA at the Olympics with immigrant parents who came here looking for opportunity - and this President has the audacity to call her teammate a "loser" after Kim just won gold? 

That's some cold-blooded stuff right there, man. It reminds me of those Monday Night Football nights in 1964 when the Packers were testing out the format before it officially launched six years later. You never know what kind of craziness might come your way on primetime TV or from the highest office.

But Kim's got the grit and grace to handle it like a pro athlete should - she says "I'm proud to represent the United States," which is 100% correct, but then adds "we are allowed to voice our opinions." And boy oh boy does she ever have plenty of those. That's what makes her such a compelling figure in this whole mess.

She understands that immigrant success stories like hers wouldn't be possible without the freedoms and opportunities afforded by America - just as CC Sabathia would never have had the chance to pitch for the Brewers if not for his own family's journey from the Dominican Republic. 

But she also knows her place, her voice matters, and she won't hesitate to speak out on what's going on in this country today. That takes serious guts and character - two things that Chloe Kim has plenty of.

This Olympic champ is a true role model for anyone who's ever been called a "loser" or doubted their ability to succeed despite the odds stacked against them. She's showing the world how to stay classy, keep your head up high, and never back down from what you believe in - both on and off the snowboarding halfpipe.

*stands up and grabs his whistle again, ready to call a timeout if needed* 

Chloe Kim is my kind of player - fierce competitor who knows how to win with grace. Keep it real out there Champ!
