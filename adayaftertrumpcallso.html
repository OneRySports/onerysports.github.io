Known for her fierce athleticism and even fiercer attitude, she has always been vocal about her political beliefs, which often put her at odds with President Trump.

In a recent interview, Kim spoke out after Trump called one of her teammates "a loser." She stated that while she is proud to represent the United States, given all the opportunities her immigrant family was afforded by this country, it's also important for athletes and citizens alike to voice their opinions on what's going on.

"I'm really proud to represent the United States," Kim said in an Instagram post. "The U.S. has given my family so much opportunity, but I also think we are allowed to voice our opinions on what’s going on."

Kim's comments come as no surprise to those who follow her closely. She has been a vocal critic of Trump since he took office and has not shied away from speaking out against his policies and actions. In 2019, she tweeted about the importance of being an ally to marginalized communities and how it is our responsibility to use our platform for good.

Her stance on politics may have put her at odds with some fans and even members of the media, but Kim remains steadfast in her beliefs. She understands that as a public figure, she has the power to influence others and believes it's important to use that power responsibly.
"For me, I feel like it’s my duty," Kim said during an interview with Vogue magazine last year. "I have a platform, so why wouldn't you try to make change?"

Kim's dedication to activism doesn't end there; she also founded the Chloe Kim Foundation in 2016, which aims to empower young people through education and community service projects. Through this foundation, Kim has been able to give back to communities that have supported her throughout her career.
In a recent article by The New York Times, Kim spoke about how growing up as an immigrant child shaped her views on social justice issues: "I think my parents taught me that we should be open-minded and compassionate towards people from different backgrounds."

As for Trump's comments about one of her teammates being a "loser," Kim chose not to directly address them in her statement. However, it is clear that she stands by the right of athletes and all Americans to express their opinions without fear of backlash or judgment.
Chloe Kim may be a champion on the snowboard, but she's also making waves off the mountain with her unwavering commitment to social justice and activism. And while some may criticize her for speaking out against those in power, there is no denying that her actions are inspiring others to use their voices for good.
