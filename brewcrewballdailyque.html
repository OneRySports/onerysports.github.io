But after looking at it more closely, I think Milwaukee might have pulled off a bit of a heist here. Trading away three infielders who were ranked 1-2-3 on their depth chart in exchange for two pitchers and another utility guy seems like a strange move at first glance.

But let's break down what the Brewers are getting from this deal: Kyle Harrison has the potential to fit into the starting rotation or be used as a long-relief arm, similar to how they've used Aaron Ashby and DL Hall in recent seasons. And while Shane Drohan might not make it to the majors right away, he could develop into a solid pitching prospect for the future.

On the flip side, David Hamilton is being brought in as another utility infielder. While his offensive numbers aren't exactly impressive (he was actually worse than Joey Ortiz last season), the Brewers are known for prioritizing defense when building their lineup. So even if Hamilton doesn't contribute much with the bat, he could still provide valuable depth at a position they needed to shore up.

Now let's talk about what the Red Sox gave up in this trade: Caleb Durbin, Andruw Monasterio, and Anthony Seigler were all highly-ranked prospects on Milwaukee's depth chart. Losing three top infielders like that is a significant blow for Boston, especially when they're dealing with their own injuries at the position.

In my opinion, while this deal might have seemed unusual at first glance, I think the Brewers came out ahead in this trade. They addressed some of their pitching needs while still maintaining depth on defense across multiple positions. And although the Red Sox got rid of some promising young talent, it's hard to argue against any team that can add a potential starting pitcher like Harrison to their rotation.

So who won the Brewers-Red Sox trade? I'm going with Milwaukee in this one – but let me know what you think in the comments below!
