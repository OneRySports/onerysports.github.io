The Brewers sent three infielders, Caleb Durbin, Andruw Monasterio, and Anthony Seigler, along with a draft pick to Boston for two pitchers, Kyle Harrison and Shane Drohan, and a utility infielder named David Hamilton. This deal has left fans wondering who came out on top in this swap.

On one hand, the Brewers have gained some pitching depth with Harrison and Drohan joining their rotation or bullpen. They also acquired an additional infielder in Hamilton, who provides solid defensive capabilities even if he doesn't offer much offensively. However, the loss of Durbin, Monasterio, and Seigler, who were all ranked highly on the team's depth chart at third base, leaves a gaping hole for Milwaukee to fill before the season begins.

As for the Red Sox, they gained some infield prospects in return for two pitchers and an infielder. But with Durbin, Monasterio, and Seigler being relatively young players who could have had potential, Boston may be the ones who ended up getting a good deal out of this trade. They added depth to their roster without sacrificing too much from theirs.

Overall, it's tough to say who truly won in this trade since both teams got something valuable that they were looking for. The Brewers gained pitching and an infielder while losing some infield prospects, but the Red Sox picked up some more prospects at the expense of some pitchers and a utility player. It will be interesting to see how both teams fare during spring training as they work on filling out their rosters before opening day arrives.
