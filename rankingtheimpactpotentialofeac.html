With twelve new faces joining the Hurricanes, they are sure to have an impact on their 2023 season. But which of these additions will make the biggest difference?

First up is running back Tyler Tucker. A former four-star recruit from Ohio, Tucker brings much-needed depth at a position that was thin last season. With the departure of key contributors, he could be in line for significant playing time and carries. His size, speed, and power should fit Miami's run-heavy scheme perfectly.

Wide receiver Jeremiah Payton is another transfer who figures to play right away. He comes from Ole Miss but has family ties to South Florida, so he's familiar with the area. His experience at a Power 5 program will help him adjust quickly, and he could be a deep threat for Tyler Van Dyke downfield.

The offensive line gets a boost with the arrival of four-star prospect Tyler Smith. A native Texan who originally signed with Texas Tech before transferring to Miami, he should compete for a starting spot. The O-line was an area of concern last year so adding talent like Smith is crucial if they want to protect Van Dyke and open up holes in the running game.

On defense, defensive end Jason Marshall Jr. stands out among the transfers. After two seasons at Notre Dame where he recorded 7 sacks and 15 tackles for loss, he brings instant impact on the edge. The Canes desperately need help there after losing star pass rusher Gregory Rousseau so Marshall could be a game-changer in '23.

Linebacker Jaylan Ford is also expected to make an immediate contribution. He had two productive seasons at Texas before transferring and should slide right into Miami's 3-4 scheme where he can rush the passer from his outside linebacker spot or drop back into coverage. With the departure of last year's starter, Ford could be a first-team All-AAC candidate if he stays healthy.

In terms of betting implications, the transfer portal additions give me more confidence in backing Miami this fall. The Canes lost some key players to graduation and the draft but replacing them with guys like Marshall Jr., Ford, and Tucker should mitigate any drops-off on defense or at skill positions. As long as Tyler Van Dyke has weapons to throw to and protection up front, I expect this offense to be just as potent if not more so than last year's group which led the AAC in total yards per game (518) and scoring (42 points).

Looking ahead to Week 1 matchup against Florida State - that's a tough out for any team let alone one still finding its identity under new head coach Mario Cristobal. But with these twelve transfers adding depth, experience, and talent across the roster, I like Miami covering as an 8-point dog in Tallahassee on September 2nd. They have too much firepower offensively to go down quietly against their archrival.
