Now that's some classy stuff right there - not many teams in any sport do this anymore, but when they do you know it means something special. 

Longo was a beast on the diamond for Tampa Bay over 12 seasons before he got traded to San Francisco last year. That move really hurt the Rays, I'll be honest with ya. But you can't blame him for wanting to chase that World Series ring and finally get some hardware after playing so long in Oakland's shadow. 

Still, what Evan did for this franchise is undeniable - 214 home runs, 876 RBIs, a Rookie of the Year award, three All-Star selections...the list goes on. He was the face of that team when they were fighting against the odds to make noise in the AL East. I remember watching him crush some absolute moonshots at Tropicana Field back in the day - dude had serious pop! 

And now he gets this proper sendoff with his number hanging up there forever alongside legends like Wade Boggs and Frank Thomas. That's how you treat a player who gave everything to your organization, no matter where they end up later on. It speaks volumes about Evan Longoria as a person too - I bet he'll be real humbled by this honor after everything he accomplished on the field. 

So cheers to 'Longo' and his #3 jersey retirement weekend in Tampa Bay! It's nice to see pro sports still recognize and celebrate their own history every once in awhile. Those moments are what it's all about - not the wins or losses, but the people who leave a lasting mark on your team. And Evan Longoria most certainly did that for the Rays over his career.
