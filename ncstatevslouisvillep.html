Your Ry-Guy is breaking down the big showdown between NC State and Louisville in this college hoops clash of titans. I've got the inside scoop on the spread, moneyline, and my expert pick for who's gonna come out on top. 

First off, let me tell you about these two squads. We're lookin' at a classic battle of grit and grind here. NC State is a hard-nosed team with a defense that can stop even the most explosive offenses. They've got size, length, and the toughness to hang in there until the final buzzer. Meanwhile, Louisville brings an offensive attack that's as sharp as a tack. Their guards can penetrate at will, get their teammates open looks, and drain threes from beyond the arc. It's gonna be a fun one for sure!

Now let's get down to business with the numbers game. According to my sources, NC State is currently the +4.5 underdog against Louisville on the spread. That means if you bet on the Wolfpack, they have to win by at least five points or lose by four or less for your ticket to cash in. As for the moneyline, it's gonna cost ya a pretty penny to back NC State - around $130 to win $100. On the flip side, Louisville is listed as an even-money favorite, meaning you'll get your original wager plus equal winnings if they come out on top.

So what's my expert take? I'm putting my money and reputation on the line here folks! In this one, it's all about which team can handle the pressure better when the game gets close down the stretch. And that's where Louisville has a slight edge in my book. Their backcourt duo of Sheppard and Johnson is too much for NC State to contain, especially if they're able to get into their offensive rhythm early on. I expect the Cardinals to pull away late in the fourth quarter and cover the spread with some points to spare.

That's all she wrote from Ry-Guy! Thanks for tuning in and remember - bet smart out there my friends. Now let's see who's gonna be hoisting that trophy at the end of the night!
