I've been watching this situation unfold with interest, and I gotta say, it's a relief to see law enforcement stepping up their presence around the former Bucks great's old stomping grounds. Nancy was a legend on that hardwood back in her day, and she still holds a special place in the hearts of Milwaukee sports fans.

I remember watching her play during my early days as a ref - she had such grace and finesse out there. It's too bad her career was cut short by those pesky knee injuries. I'm sure she'd appreciate all this extra protection around her old crib, even if it is just for the neighborhood's peace of mind these days.

At the end of the day, this move shows that Milwaukee cops are still looking out for their own - and anyone else who calls our city home. That kind of dedication to community safety has been a trademark of our local law enforcement for decades now. It's why we always knew we could count on them when things got tough in this town.

So here's to Nancy Guthrie, one of the greats, and to the brave men and women who keep watch over her legacy - both on and off the court. We're lucky to have you all looking out for us, especially in these trying times.
