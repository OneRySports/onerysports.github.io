As of now, the team is $181.3 million guaranteed for 15 players on their roster, which puts them $6.5 million below the tax threshold. The Bucks are currently operating as an over-the-cap team with no remaining cap space but have avoided any hard caps at either apron level in the 2025-26 season.

While they lost access to the full mid-level exception and bi-annual exception by creating some cap room last July, they still had a room exception of $8.8 million available to sign Kevin Porter Jr. for $5.1 million. With approximately $3.6m remaining on that room exception before it begins prorating down in January, the Bucks have limited financial flexibility to make significant moves this season.

One interesting aspect of the Bucks' situation is their relationship with the first and second apron levels. For 2025-26, they are currently $11.8 million beneath the first apron and $23.7 million beneath the second apron. This means that they face none of the restrictions associated with being above either apron level. However, if they were to pay luxury tax in three of any four consecutive seasons, they would be subject to more punitive repeater penalties.

The Bucks' draft pick situation is also worth noting. They can only trade their own first-round picks in the 2031 and 2032 NBA Drafts, with no others available for trade. This limited asset could prove valuable in future deals, but it's not an immediate concern given their current financial standing.

Looking ahead to next season (2026-27), there is a possibility that the Bucks will become taxpayers again if they fail to remain below the tax threshold once more. However, if they do manage to avoid paying luxury taxes in 2026-27, they would reset their clock and could potentially finish above it in 2027-28 without facing any repeater penalties.

Overall, while the Bucks have made some smart moves this offseason to navigate the salary cap waters, they are still operating with limited financial flexibility for significant roster changes during the upcoming season. Their focus will likely be on maintaining their playoff position and potentially making a run at another championship title before considering more drastic measures in future offseasons when more options may become available.
