The Seahawks quarterback has consistently put up impressive numbers this season, and his performance in Super Bowl LX against the Patriots was no exception. Despite being a relatively unknown player heading into the game, Darnold came out guns blazing and led his team to an emphatic victory over the defending champions.

From the outset, it seemed clear that the Seahawks were the more prepared team on both sides of the ball. Their defense dominated early, sacking Patriots quarterback Tom Brady multiple times and forcing several turnovers. Meanwhile, Darnold showcased his arm strength and accuracy with a series of deep throws to set up Seattle's offense in scoring position after scoring position.

As the game wore on, it became apparent that the Seahawks were playing with a sense of confidence and swagger that is often associated with championship teams. They executed their plays flawlessly and never seemed flustered by the pressure of being underdogs in this high-stakes contest. And while Brady did manage to mount a comeback attempt towards the end of regulation, it was ultimately too little too late for New England's aging quarterback.

In fact, there were several moments throughout the game where I couldn't help but marvel at just how well Darnold was performing. His decision-making under pressure was top-notch, and his ability to read defenses quickly allowed him to find open receivers time after time. This is what sets apart great quarterbacks from good ones - they make plays when their team needs them most, which is exactly what happened here today.
