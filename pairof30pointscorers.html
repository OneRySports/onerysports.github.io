This game? Two players dropped 30 each in the same contest to knock off No. 10 Oklahoma. That's pure basketball artistry right there, y'all. 

Reminds me of when Michael Redd went for a career-high 57 on the Bucks – that was back in '06 if I recall correctly. Scored like he was auditioning for an NBA all-time great highlight reel. And then later this year, Giannis Antetokounmpo broke that record with 64 points himself. That's how you make history out here – by showing up and letting it rip when the lights are bright and the stakes are high.

This Vanderbilt pair? They're doing the same thing on their stage tonight. Two studs, two scorers, both dropping triple-digits on a ranked opponent. It doesn't get much sweeter than that in my book. Oklahoma might be No. 10 but they got schooled by some real ballers who came to play. 

That's what I love about the game – no matter how good you are or where you're from, if you can hit your shots and bring it every single night, you've got a chance at greatness. This Vanderbilt duo proved that tonight. They didn't just win, they showed out and made believers of everyone in the arena. That's the kind of gritty excellence I live for as a ref, a Sharp bettor, and a Wisconsin sports fan through and through. 

Let this be a lesson to all you teams out there – if you want to beat the odds like these Commodores did tonight? You gotta bring your A-game every single night and let it fly when it matters most. No half-stepping allowed! Now where's my popcorn because I know that replay is going to be epic.
