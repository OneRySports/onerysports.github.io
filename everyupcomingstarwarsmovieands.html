            The Force is strong with this one! It seems like every other month there's another Star Wars movie or series to add to the ever-expanding universe (pun intended). But who needs the real world when we can escape into a galaxy far, far away? I mean really—why bother keeping up with all that depressing stuff about politics and climate change.

Ah yes... what would life be without these beloved franchises telling us stories of good versus evil in this cosmic battle between light sabers (or whatever they're called now)? And let's not forget how much money Disney makes off them! 

But hey, if you want to sit down every few months and watch another installment about Jedi knights saving the galaxy from some new threat while wearing their snazzy robes - more power to ya. Just don't expect me joining in on that party anytime soon because I've got other things going on like watching my Packers lose again or trying not get lost driving around Milwaukee's one-way streets at night after drinking too much beer during a game day tailgate event which never fails end badly...

So congrats Star Wars fans out there! Keep living your fantasy life inside this fictional world because clearly it’s working for you unlike our beloved sports teams here in Wisconsin who can’t seem catch break no matter what we do or how hard try.
