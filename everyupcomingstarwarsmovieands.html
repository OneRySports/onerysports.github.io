                The Ry-Guy here, reporting live from the frozen tundra of Mukwonago – where even our local Dairyland pride can't hide this latest batch of Star Wars announcements! As I shoveled my way out to cover today's news about all those upcoming movies and series with "key details" (or so they say), I couldn’t help but wonder if we're in for another round of intergalactic nonsense from Disney. 

After the debacle that was The Last Jedi, which had folks throwing popcorn at their screens faster than a Wookiee chomping on raw meatballs – remember when Luke Skywalker just gave up? Yeah... - I’m not exactly jumping outta my mukluks to praise this new batch of "key details." And don't even get me started about The Rise Of Skywalker; it felt like someone took all the good bits from previous films, chewed 'em with their teeth and spat them back on a silver platter. Now they want us excited for more? Please!

But hey - let’s not forget that while we're busy speculating over what new characters will join our beloved cast (and how many times Kylo Ren's gonna flip out), there are real issues at stake in Wisconsin like... well, just look outside right now – it’s colder than Hoth during wintertime! And if you ask me? We’re already getting too much "Star Wars" action without needing to watch another movie or show about space wizards. 

So go ahead and make your own lightsabers with glow sticks this holiday season; I’ll stick by my mug of hot chocolate (made from real Wisconsin dairy!) while keeping an eye out for any actual news worth reporting on here in good ol’ Mukwonago!
