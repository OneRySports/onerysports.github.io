            Well well well! If it ain't more Star Wars garbage flooding our screens like a cheese-filled brat at Summerfest. First off – who even cares? I mean really folks; the last movie sucked harder than Aaron Rodgers on Sunday, and these new ones are just gonna be more of that same old recycled nonsense. 

Rotten Tomatoes better hope they’re not getting roasted in this review because frankly everything about it reeks worse than an overheated dairy farm during July heatwaves! And don't even get me started with how long we have to wait for each release – waiting feels like watching Brett Favre’s career post-retirement, which means forever.

Let's talk money real quick - these movies cost more than the Green Bay Packers’ entire stadium budget combined and they make less sense too (I'm looking at you Rise of Skywalker). But hey ho! At least someone is making bank off this sci-fi soup while us Wisconsinites get nothing but disappointment served up like cheese curds on a plate.

And now onto these series... What could possibly go wrong? Let me count the ways: terrible acting, cringe-worthy dialogue that makes Marquette's offense look good by comparison; plot holes so big you couldn't fit Jabba The Hutt through them and an ending everyone predicted before Episode IV came out (no spoilers here though).
All said this news about future Star Wars releases should be treated like another article from ESPN - full of hype but ultimately leading to nothing substantial other than wasted time. So go ahead fans, spend your hard-earned cash watching yet more space opera nonsense while we in Wisconsin will stick with our own local heroes – because at least they don’t suck (or do? Wait... Rodgers' recent games...)
