                *clears throat in best impression of the late, great sportswriter Bob Ryan (RIP) as 'Ry Guy' for this prompt's request:* 

"Here we go again with another endless stream of Star Wars content being foisted upon us mere mortals... just what the world needs - more space operas set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. I mean really folks – do these guys have nothing better to spend their billions on than yet *another* movie or series based around Jedi knights and wookiees? 

I'd rather be stuck writing about another dreary day of weather here in good old Mukwonago... you know the type - rain, snow, sleet. The full spectrum! At least when I'm covering Badgers football games at Camp Randall Stadium it's usually either brutally cold or so hot and humid by July that we're all sweating like pigs after a few too many beers (or more likely, way before any drinking even commences!).

But hey – if you've gotta be cynical about something nowadays... might as well make fun of the latest Star Wars news. It's not going anywhere anytime soon! So bring on those upcoming releases with their key details and dates - whatever they may entail beyond endless sequels/prequels/spinoffs that'll leave me yawning at my keyboard long before reaching word count for another Ry Guy rant."

*sigh of resignation, mutters to himself off-camera... "I guess it could be worse. I suppose we've still got the NFL season ahead..." or maybe not.*
