            Well isn't this just the most unexpected news to come out of Silicon Valley since that time Steve Jobs was spotted eating at Applebee's? Three Xbox games getting dated for Nintendo Switch 2 and Starfield supposedly making its way over to PS5 in April - it must be nice living on Easy Street, having all your consoles play nicely together. 

But really folks, what does this mean exactly? Are we witnessing the beginning of a new era where console wars are nothing more than fond memories for us gamers out here in Wisconsin who'd rather spend our time watching professional wrestling and drinking beer at Miller Park anyway? Or is it just another example of corporate greed trying to pull one over on unsuspecting consumers with cross-platform compatibility that will ultimately leave everyone feeling cheated.

As if we don't have enough distractions already - from tailgating before Packer games, arguing about whether cheese curds belong in brats or not and keeping an eye out for deer running amok during rush hour traffic while listening to our beloved Badger football team dominate on Saturdays come fall season! Who needs another reason to stay indoors playing video games when life here is already so exciting?

So let's see where this little saga takes us next, shall we. I mean sure it might be convenient having access across multiple platforms but at what cost really - after all nobody said living in Madison meant anything more than being surrounded by beautiful lakes and endless opportunities for outdoor recreation which makes spending countless hours glued to your TV screen seem trivial indeed when compared with exploring nature's bounty right outside our doorsteps.
