            Well folks, it's about time Microsoft started listening to the consumers! I mean who needs exclusives on their own platform when they can just let Nintendo and Sony have all of them instead? It seems like Xbox is really thinking outside that "Xbox" box with these new deals for Switch 2 in April. Oh wait... Starfield might also be coming over to PlayStation too while we're at it! What's the point anymore if every game gets ported everywhere anyway, right?

I'll give 'em credit though - this move shows a certain amount of cleverness from our friends on Redmond: Letting third parties develop games they never asked for but somehow end up getting because "that would be cool" was mentioned once during an interview. But hey! Maybe by next year we could finally get some actual sports titles released outside those crappy mobile apps?

Don't worry folks, there's always hope - even in these bleak times when major franchises go multi-platform just to keep investors happy while gamers are left with nothing but disappointment and empty promises from developers who think making another open-world RPG set during the Middle Ages is what we want instead of something actually new or exciting!
Keep your eyes peeled though because apparently according to some sources "Three Xbox Games Dated For Nintendo Switch 2, Starfield Also Rumoured To Be Coming Over" which means maybe next holiday season there might be a chance that one day soon everyone can play each others' games no matter what system they own.
