According to NBA.com, Milwaukee Bucks legend Sidney Moncrief is being honored by having his jersey number officially retired on February 13th during a game against the Atlanta Hawks. This is a long overdue tribute for one of the greatest defensive players in the history of our great city's basketball team.

Moncrief was drafted by the Bucks back in '79 and played for them until '89. During his career, he won two Defensive Player of the Year awards - which at that time were a new honor to be given out each year. He also helped lead the Bucks to their only NBA Championship in 1971 as well as an Eastern Conference Finals appearance in '83. His grit and determination on defense made him a fan favorite, and now we'll get to celebrate his legacy at Fiserv Forum.

It's been a long time coming, but better late than never I suppose! This is definitely something that all true Milwaukee sports fans should be excited about. Even if you're not usually into basketball, Sidney Moncrief was such an important part of our city's history - it's worth taking some time to learn more about what he accomplished during his playing days here in Wisconsin.

So mark your calendars for February 13th and get ready to honor one of the greatest defenders that ever put on a Bucks uniform! The retirement ceremony should be quite special, especially since Sidney will finally get the recognition he deserves from both the organization and its fans.
