I'm not sure how much good that would do anyone in the long run and it could potentially lead to a lot of problems down the line for those next guys in charge. 

I mean, look at what happened with Terry Fontenot and the Atlanta Falcons. He was on the hot seat but still managed to trade away future draft picks for James Pearce Jr., who ended up getting arrested on some serious charges. Instead of having to deal with the consequences of that move himself, it falls onto Matt Ryan's shoulders now. 

It just seems like a recipe for disaster if teams are allowed more leeway when it comes to trading future draft picks. The last thing we need is another situation where someone gets stuck cleaning up after some desperate decision-makers on the hot seat.

If you ask me, they should tie these trades to the timeline of general managers' contracts instead. That way, only those who have earned an extension would be able to make such moves and it would prevent teams from burning through their assets too quickly. 

At the end of the day though, I guess we'll just have to wait and see what comes out of these talks between the NFL owners. But one thing's for sure - if they're not careful, this could really hurt parity in the league over time.
