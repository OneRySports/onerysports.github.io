It's like letting a hot-shot GM with a shaky contract run amok with your team's future draft picks – not exactly a smart move if you're trying to keep things competitive.

Think about it: If we let these guys trade away picks five years down the line, what stops them from making some wild gamble on a "talented" player with red flags in their past? You know how that goes – one bad decision and your team's future could be mortgaged for nothing more than a flashy name.

It reminds me of the old days when the Brewers first came to Milwaukee back in 1970, giving our state baseball fans something new to cheer about. But even then, they had to build their team from the ground up, one smart draft pick at a time. You can't just trade away your future prospects for some instant gratification – it's not how you win championships.

So I say, let's keep things simple and keep the NFL draft window where it is. No more giving these hot-shot GMs too much rope to hang themselves with. If they want to make a big splash, they should do it with their own picks, not by mortgaging your team's future for a quick fix.

In this league, just like in basketball or any other sport, you have to build things the right way – one smart move at a time. And that means being careful about who you trust with your most valuable assets: your draft picks. So let's not make it easier for these guys to blow it up and leave a mess for the next guy to clean up. That's just bad business, plain and simple.
