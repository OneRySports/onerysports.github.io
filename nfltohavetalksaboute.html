And in the NFL, that's exactly what seems to be happening once again. According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, there are talks about extending the window for traded draft choices from three years into five.
As a 20-year veteran basketball ref and sports fanatic from Mukwonago, WI, I've seen my fair share of changes in the league over the years. But this one has me scratching my head. First off, rarely are any players worth five seasons’ worth of draft selections. It just doesn't seem necessary to allow teams to trade picks that far out into the future.
But that's not all - this change could also give hot-seat general managers and coaches more access to burn draft choices, making things harder for the next person in their position. Just look at the 2025 Atlanta Falcons as an example. Despite never posting a winning record in four seasons on the job, Terry Fontenot was kept around by owner Arthur Blank for another draft pick. And what did he do? He traded away the team's 2026 first-round pick and more to snag Tennessee edge rusher James Pearce Jr., who ended up being arrested for five felony charges this past weekend.
If the league were smart, they would tie in the window in which teams can trade picks to the timeline of general managers' contracts. If a GM's contract only lasts one year into the future, why should they be able to borrow from five years down the line? It just seems like a terrible process for a league that has been built on parity.
So what do you think? Is extending the window for traded draft choices a good idea or not? Let me know your thoughts in the comments below!
