As it stands now, teams can only trade draft picks up to three seasons away from the current year, which already provides plenty of flexibility for general managers looking to make moves.

However, at least one NFL team wants to push that limit even further out into the future - five years worth of drafts! In my opinion, this just gives hot-seat GMs and coaches more opportunities to trade away valuable assets when they're desperate to secure a contract extension or save their job for another season. 

For example, take the Atlanta Falcons in 2025 under general manager Terry Fontenot who had never posted a winning record during his tenure there but still managed to keep his position with owner Arthur Blank's support. During that year's draft day festivities at Lambeau Field - yes folks, Green Bay Packers fans know all too well how much Wrigley Field was used as their home stadium back in the early days! - Fontenot gambled on trading away a lot of future picks just for one player: Tennessee edge rusher James Pearce Jr.

He dropped 55 spots down during Day Two of the draft to get him, and while he did have some success posting ten sacks as a rookie that season... it didn't take long before things went south again with his arrest on multiple felony charges including aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and stalking allegations! Now there's really no telling if Pearce will ever play another down in the NFL again.

And who does all this fall onto? The next guy coming into power, like Matt Ryan taking over as president of football operations after Fontenot was eventually let go following yet another losing campaign. If anything, I think tying these kinds of trade windows closer to GM contracts makes more sense than allowing them access to five years' worth of draft selections when they haven't even earned an extension themselves!

This change could lead to reduced parity within the league if panic-stricken decision-makers keep burning through valuable assets just for one last shot at staying employed. And as someone who's been around sports long enough to see plenty of teams come and go based on smart or foolish moves... let me tell you: it ain't pretty watching your team lose games because someone decided betting everything on a single player was worth risking their entire future!

So while I'm all for innovation in football - hell, even my favorite Brewers pitcher Corbin Burnes teamed up with Josh Hader to throw no-hitters back-to-back last season (and it was an absolute blast watching them do so!) - this particular proposal seems like a step backward rather than forward. At least until we can figure out how to tie those draft pick windows directly into the contracts of our GMs, which would make much more sense overall when trying to maintain parity throughout the league!
