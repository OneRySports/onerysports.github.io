Week 17 Power Rankings: East teams making moves 
Hey folks, it's The Ry-Guy here. We're nearing the end of another exciting regular season in the NBA and the playoff picture is starting to take shape. Let me break down where some of my favorite Eastern Conference teams stand heading into Week 17 action.

The Knicks have been hot as hell lately, winning 5 of their last 6 games including a big one on the road against Boston. They've moved up in these rankings and are looking like a legit playoff threat again for the first time in a long while. The front office deserves credit for finally getting this ship turned around.

Meanwhile over in Beantown, the Celtics have been playing some lights-out basketball themselves. Jayson Tatum is averaging 30 ppg on 57% shooting and Kemba Walker looks like his old self again. They're going to be a tough out in the postseason if they can keep this up down the stretch.

And don't sleep on those Cavs either, my friends. Collin Sexton has been balling out of his mind with that game-winner against Milwaukee last week. If they can get Kevin Love back healthy and rolling again, they could make some noise in the East. 

But enough about the future, let's talk about some recent history - like that heartbreaking Hail Mary Kirk Cousins threw to beat the Badgers at Michigan State back in 2011. Ouch! Still hurts thinking about it. We're not supposed to bring up that kind of pain during a basketball discussion though... my bad.

Anyway, I'm excited to see how these Week 17 games shake out and who ends up clinching playoff spots by the end of the regular season. Until next time, keep your eyes on the ball (and maybe avoid those Hail Mary passes).
