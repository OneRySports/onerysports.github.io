The NBA's Eastern Conference playoff race is heating up down the stretch, with the New York Knicks, Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers making key moves this past week to position themselves for postseason contention. 

In a surprising development, the Bucks blew a 2-0 lead against the Toronto Raptors in the second round of the playoffs last season before ultimately falling to Kawhi Leonard's team. That painful loss is still fresh on Milwaukee fans' minds as they watch other Eastern Conference teams make strides toward securing playoff spots this year.

While the Bucks have been steady, it appears some other contenders may be gaining ground. The Knicks have been red-hot of late with a young core that could make waves in May. Boston has found its rhythm and looks to be peaking at the right time behind their All-Star trio. And Cleveland continues to surprise with their gritty defense and efficient offense, led by their own budding star.

As we approach Week 18, all eyes will be on how these teams perform over the final stretch run. Can the Bucks stay atop the Eastern Conference or are they in danger of being passed? It's going to come down to who handles pressure best when every game matters most heading into May. The Bucks have a chance to avenge last year's heartbreaking loss if they can maintain their position at the top and earn home-court advantage in this year's playoffs.
