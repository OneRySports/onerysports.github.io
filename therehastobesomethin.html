There's a saying around these parts. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." And boy oh boy do I love me some Matt Arnold. The Brewers' GM is one of the few front office types that has made some real noise and some real moves in Milwaukee over the last couple years. And let me tell ya, this trade for Caleb Durbin from last year? That was a good'un. But now we're left wondering what's next, because Arnold sure as heck ain't standing still.

The Brewers sent off Durbin along with Andruw Monasterio and Anthony Seigler to Boston in exchange for Kyle Harrison, David Hamilton, and Shane Drohan. The Brewers' third base depth chart is now in the hands of the Red Sox. After shortstop Joey Ortiz, the most experienced third baseman on the Brewers roster is Andrew Vaughn – yep, that's right, Andrew Vaughn. And to be honest with you? That just doesn't sit well with me.

There has to be something coming. Arnold isn't a man known for sitting back and doing nothing, so I'm expecting some kind of move before too long. Who is going to play third base if Jett Williams hasn't made his major league debut yet? Maybe they're moving Ortiz back to third base – that would mean the Brewers are confident in Williams' ability to become an everyday contributor next year. Or maybe Andrew Fischer and Jesus Made are closer to ready than we think, or Sal Frelick has been taking some extra reps at third.

Maybe it's a trade for Isaac Paredes or Alec Bohm. Maybe it’s someone most fans haven’t heard of yet who will end up hitting .270 and leading the league in hit by pitches. There has to be something coming, right? Because if not...well then we're back to square one with Andrew Vaughn at third base – and that ain't a position I want to see him in on a regular basis.

In all honesty though, this move could end up being genius. Harrison is a former top-25 prospect and the main piece of this trade. Hamilton had an impressive 2024 season (despite hitting under .200), while Drohan has shown some promise with his performance in AAA last year – even if he did have an ERA over 5 in both '23 and '24.

So maybe Arnold is looking at the big picture here, thinking that this trade will pay off down the line when these young players really start to shine on the field. And hey, who knows? Maybe we'll look back on this moment as one of those defining moments for the Brewers franchise – like that time Matt LaPorta hit a home run in his first at-bat or when Ryan Braun broke out with 34 homers in '07.

But until then...I'm gonna keep holding my breath and waiting to see what comes next. Because as much as I love seeing good moves happen here, there's always room for improvement – especially when it comes to third base. And you know what they say: if Arnold ain't satisfied with the current situation at third, he won't sit still until something changes!
