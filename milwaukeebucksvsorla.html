After beating up on some bad opponents, the Bucks battle with a playoff team
Where We’re At
As mentioned, the Bucks just went 3-0 on their homestand, beating the Bulls, Pelicans, and Pacers. During that span, they ranked second in offensive rating (17th on D, but let’s not talk about that). Ryan Rollins has looked back to his damaging self, highlighted by a 27-point performance in Milwaukee’s OT win over New Orleans. Kevin Porter Jr. has also been stuffing the stat sheet since returning from injury against Chicago, averaging 20.5 PPG, 8.5 APG, 6.5 RPG, and a whopping 4.0 SPG over his last two. Although he won’t play tonight, it will be interesting to see how the signing of Cam Thomas impacts the rhythm both Rollins and Porter have been in lately.
After making something of an all-in trade for Desmond Bane in the offseason, the Magic have been relatively disappointing this year, sitting just above .500. They have beaten the Nets and Jazz in their last two, both of which don’t plan on winning another game this year (and I mean they really don’t plan on it; I’m looking at YOU, Utah). Hilariously, The Magic’s streak of ending the year in the bottom third in offensive efficiency, even with Bane in tow this season, is still alive—they currently sit 21st. Relatedly, they rank 26th in effective field goal percentage. Suffice to say, the Magic are beatable if the Bucks can shoot the ball well (as they often do, ranking third in EFG% this season). But the biggest reason for the Magic’s sluggish season has been their defence, which is meant to be their superpower. Last year, they finished second for the season; this year, they currently sit at a middling 15th.
Injury Report
For the Bucks, Giannis (calf) and Taurean Prince (neck) are both out. For the Magic, Franz Wagner (ankle) is out.
Player To Watch
After an iffy first few years in the league, Anthony Black has taken a giant leap this season, validating his selection at sixth in the 2023 draft. His stats across the board have gone up (some even skyrocketed, such as his PPG and minutes). Black plays a crucial role for the Magic as a connector and two-way player. He’ll likely toggle between Rollins and Porter, with Jalen Suggs taking the other guy. Milwaukee’s ability to neutralise AB will go a long way to them winning this one.
