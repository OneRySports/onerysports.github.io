The Bucks have been on a roll lately, but let's not get ahead of ourselves here—they've only beaten up on some pretty poor teams as of late. Tonight, they'll face off against the Magic without Giannis Antetokounmpo and Taurean Prince, so this could be interesting to see how they fare in a real challenge.

Milwaukee has been playing well offensively, ranking second overall with an offensive rating that's impressive. Ryan Rollins has really stepped up his game too, putting up some big numbers against the Pelicans recently. And Kevin Porter Jr. is back from injury and looking like himself again, which can only help Milwaukee's chances tonight.

On the other hand, Orlando might be struggling a bit this season but they're not pushovers by any means. They've got some firepower on their side with Desmond Bane leading them in offense—though that hasn't always translated to wins so far. The Magic have been known for being one of the better defensive teams in recent memory, though that seems to be slipping a bit this year as well.

It'll be interesting to see how these two teams match up tonight when they tip off at 6:30 p.m. CST on Peacock!
