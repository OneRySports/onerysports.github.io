The Bucks have finally snapped a frustrating skid with their first three-game win streak of the season. But here's the kicker - each of those wins came against teams that haven't won more than 5 games all year combined (Cleveland, Detroit, Charlotte). Now it's time for the real test, as they welcome a playoff-caliber Orlando team to Fiserv Forum in this must-win matchup.

Both squads are coming off a tough road loss before their respective homestands. The Bucks fell at home against the lowly Wizards last Monday while the Magic dropped a heartbreaker on the second night of a back-to-back in Boston Tuesday. Milwaukee is 3-5 since returning from All-Star break and has lost 4 straight games to teams with losing records. Orlando is also 1-4 since the break, getting blown out twice by the Celtics at home before their narrow loss in Boston.

Tonight's game will feature a couple of key matchups to watch closely. The Bucks' defense, which ranks dead last in the NBA (29th), will be put to the test against Orlando point guard Jalen Suggs. The 6-4 rookie has been a revelation for the Magic this season and could be poised for another big night after scoring 25 points on Tuesday. Milwaukee's defense struggled mightily with Boston's perimeter players last Monday, allowing Jaylen Brown and Derrick White to shoot over 50% from beyond the arc.

On offense, the Bucks' young backcourt will get a chance to shine without Giannis Antetokounmpo in the lineup for what looks like another extended absence due to his sprained ankle. Jrue Holiday has averaged nearly 28 points per game on over 45% shooting from deep while playing alongside Khris Middleton since Jan. 1st, but he'll be looking to get some help tonight with Antetokounmpo sidelined again. Orlando's defense ranks near the bottom of the league as well (27th), so Holiday should have plenty of opportunities to attack off the dribble and find open looks for himself or his teammates if they're able to create space on offense.

In the frontcourt, the Bucks will look to big man Brook Lopez to fill some of the void left by Antetokounmpo's absence from both an offensive and defensive standpoint. The 7-footer has been solid in recent weeks after a slow start to his second stint with Milwaukee, but he'll need to continue to build on those performances against one of the league's top low-post defenders in Nikola Vučević. Orlando's star center is averaging nearly double-doubles on over 60% shooting while also leading all NBA centers in blocks this season. The matchup between Lopez and Vučević could prove pivotal for both teams as they look to establish a foothold inside tonight.

The Bucks will be looking to bounce back from their recent struggles against Orlando, which has been one of their toughest opponents so far this season. Milwaukee is 0-3 in the regular season series with the Magic after losing three straight games earlier this year by an average margin of over 15 points per contest. However, things have changed dramatically since then as both teams have undergone major roster changes that could alter this matchup completely when they finally meet again on Monday night at Fiserv Forum.

With both squads coming off disappointing losses and looking for their first wins of the new year, tonight's game promises to be a highly competitive affair from start to finish! Let's see how these two teams fare against each other in what should prove to be an intriguing matchup between two very different styles of play.
