As I've said before, Milwaukee has been playing better of late, but each of their wins so far have been against some pretty bad teams. The Magic are a different story - they're a playoff-caliber team that's gonna give the Bucks a real test.

On offense, both teams have been hot and cold. The Bucks are currently ranked 3rd in effective field goal percentage (EFG%) this season, so if they can knock down their shots tonight, they should be able to handle Orlando's defense. That said, the Magic are known for being a tough defensive team - last year, they finished second in defensive rating!

Kevin Porter Jr. has been on fire since returning from injury, averaging 20.5 PPG, 8.5 APG, and 6.5 RPG over his last two games. If he continues to play like that tonight, it'll be tough for the Magic to contain him. Ryan Rollins has also looked good recently, dropping 27 points in Milwaukee's overtime win against New Orleans.

The Bucks will need to keep a close eye on Anthony Black - after an up-and-down first few years in the league, he's taken a giant leap this season and is now one of the Magic's most important players. He'll likely be tasked with guarding both Porter Jr. and Rollins tonight. If Milwaukee can neutralize him, they should have a good chance to come out on top.

In terms of injuries, Giannis (calf) and Taurean Prince (neck) are both out for the Bucks, while Franz Wagner (ankle) is sidelined for Orlando. The game tips off at 6:30 p.m. CST on Peacock - let's see if Milwaukee can make it four wins in a row against a legitimate opponent!
