The Olympics are supposed to be about bringing people together and celebrating athletic achievement, not partisan politics. But that hasn't stopped President Trump from inserting himself into the Games, most recently by calling a U.S. skier a "loser" for missing out on the podium.

Trump's comments were a slap in the face to Mikaela Shiffrin, who finished fourth in women's slalom skiing despite performing well above expectations given her recent struggles with injury and illness. Shiffrin is one of America's most decorated skiers ever, yet Trump chose to criticize her publicly rather than acknowledge her hard work and determination.

It's no wonder that other U.S. athletes are speaking out against the president's comments. They have a right to stand up for themselves and each other when they're being attacked from high places. The Olympics should be about sportsmanship, not political grandstanding.

As someone who's spent years officiating basketball games at every level, I know that players are often unfairly criticized by fans and pundits alike. But it takes a certain type of person to rise above the noise and focus on what really matters - giving your best performance out there on the court (or in this case, on the slopes).

That's why I admire athletes like Shiffrin who keep pushing forward even when things get tough. And that's why I think it's important for them to have a voice, especially when they're being disrespected by someone as powerful as the president of the United States. 

In my experience, it's not always easy to separate sports from politics - just ask any Packer fan about "The Catch II" in 1998! But at the end of the day, we should all be able to come together and celebrate athletic achievement without partisan bickering getting in the way. 

So let's give our Olympians some respect - they've earned it through their hard work and dedication on the field (or slope) of play. And let's hope that President Trump learns a lesson from this whole fiasco: sometimes, it pays to keep politics out of sports!
