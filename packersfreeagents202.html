They are currently fifth on the odds board for Super Bowl LXI, which is where they finished in 2025 after missing out on winning their second straight NFC Championship Game against the Buccaneers at Lambeau Field as Rodgers famously declined to run. The Packers will need to get healthier and improve upon a roster that has now lost three of its top four free agents from last season, with Rasheed Walker, Quay Walker, Sean Rhyan, and Romeo Doubs all set to hit unrestricted free agency this offseason.

The team’s most pressing decision will be at left tackle, where it seems like they are likely to lose Rasheed Walker in free agency after he played 1,064 snaps for the Packers last season. The starting left tackle market rate has ballooned to north of $20 million per year this offseason, and even below-average starters are getting that kind of money. If the Packers can’t match that offer, they will likely move on from Walker and replace him with 2024 first-round pick Jordan Morgan, who looked much better at right tackle this season than he did playing guard in his first year and a half in the league.

Another player the Packers may have to move on from is receiver Romeo Doubs, as they have a young talent like Matthew Golden waiting in the wings for an opportunity at the next level. Doubs played 818 snaps for Green Bay last season and could potentially sign with another team for around $13 million per year, which would net them a fifth-round compensatory draft choice if he leaves without being replaced by an outside free agent.

The most difficult decisions for general manager Brian Gutekunst will be at center (Sean Rhyan) and linebacker (Quay Walker), as there are no strong internal options to replace either of these players. The Packers don’t have any immediate replacements lined up at either position, which could lead to some serious roster holes if they can’t re-sign both players this offseason.

Overall, the Packers will need to make some tough decisions in free agency and potentially use their compensatory picks wisely in order to improve upon a team that has been one of the best teams in football over the past few years but is now facing an uncertain future with several key contributors set to become unrestricted free agents this offseason.
