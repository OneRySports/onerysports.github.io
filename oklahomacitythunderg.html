Let's dive in and see what these boys from the Land of Enchantment are all about. 

First off, let me tell you - when I'm on the court calling a game, I need players who can hit their shots and play defense like it matters. And boy howdy does this team have some talent!

Take Shai Gilgeous-Alexander for example. The guy is a pure scorer with handles that could make Magic Johnson blush. He's got that old-school finesse combined with modern-day athleticism - reminds me of a young Paul Molitor smashing balls in left field all over the place back in '87! 

Then there's Josh Giddey, who seems to have all the tools you'd want out of an NBA point guard. He can pass, he can shoot, and if they're lucky enough to keep him healthy then watch out world because this kid might just be something special someday soon.

But let me tell ya - as much as I love watching these young bucks light up the scoreboard (and trust me folks, it's quite a sight!), there ain't nothing more important than playing hard-nosed defense at both ends of the floor. And that's where Chet Holmgren comes into play here for OKC because let me tell ya - when he's on his game, nobody wants to go up against him one-on-one in any given situation!

So yeah, while I'll always root for my beloved Milwaukee Bucks no matter what happens come playoff time (and don't even get me started about those Packers playing their home games over at Wrigley Field back in the day!), there's definitely something special brewing down in Oklahoma City right now with this young team they've got going on. It won't be long before everyone starts taking notice of just how good these guys really are!
