Just got done watching another exciting game between the Oklahoma City Thunder and their opponents. It's been a wild ride so far this season with some clutch plays and tough defensive stands on both ends of the court. The Thunder are showing promise, but they've still got work to do if they want to make a real run at a championship.

I can't help but draw parallels between this Thunder team and my beloved Green Bay Packers from way back in 1964 when they participated in that first simulated Monday Night Football experiment. It was a bold move, testing the waters before MNF officially debuted on TV six years later. Similarly, the Thunder are pushing boundaries with their aggressive style of play under head coach Mark Daigneault's guidance.

But let's get down to brass tacks - how do we assess this team? First off, scoring is no problem as Shai Gilgeous-Alexander leads all scorers at an impressive 31 points per game while also dishing out nearly seven assists each contest. That's elite level play right there folks!

On defense though... well, that's where things get interesting. With only allowing about 120 points per 100 possessions (which ranks them around the middle of pack), it shows they're not quite there yet defensively speaking if we're talking playoffs or championship contention statuses here today people. Still better than last year though so progress is being made I'll give 'em that much credit for sure!

And what about those young bucks? Chet Holmgren has shown flashes of brilliance since joining the squad after getting drafted first overall last April. He's averaging almost 15 points and seven rebounds per night while shooting nearly fifty percent from behind arc too boot - not bad considering his age or lack thereof really now is it?

Jalen Williams another rookie sensation who came into league via trade just like Holmgren did seems to be finding his groove more each passing day as well averaging over 14 points and five boards nightly alongside decent shooting numbers across board.

But let's talk about what matters most - winning games, baby! And while they've got some wins under their belt already this season (like beating off Chicago Bulls), losses against top tier squads such us Miami Heat or Boston Celtics prove there still room improvement needed especially when facing elite competition come playoff time if hope remains alive.

So where does that leave us then? Well, it leaves me cautiously optimistic but not overly excited yet either way shape form factor whatsoever really now isn't it? They're showing potential sure enough, but until they can consistently compete with the best teams in the league night after night and come out on top more often than not, we'll have to wait and see what this Thunder squad is truly made of.

In conclusion folks, while there's definitely something brewing down in Oklahoma City right about now, don't go putting your house on them just yet if you know what I mean. They've still got a ways to go before they can claim any real hardware or titles around their necks so keep your eyes peeled for more updates as this season progresses further along its course!
