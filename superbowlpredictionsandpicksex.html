Looks like the big game is finally here, folks. Time to put on your Sunday best and get ready for some gridiron action as we head into Super Bowl LVIII between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers. This one has all the makings of a classic showdown with two powerhouses vying for ultimate glory in Tampa Bay.

But before you settle in to enjoy this epic contest, let me give you my take on what's going to happen out there on the field. As someone who knows the game inside and out – both from years as a referee AND being one sharp bettor - I've got an edge over most talking heads. 

First things first: Kansas City is the team to beat here, plain and simple. Patrick Mahomes has been playing at an MVP level all season long, leading the Chiefs to an 18-1 record (best in the NFL). And if you ask me? He's only going to get better come Super Bowl Sunday when he's got that chip on his shoulder trying to prove doubters wrong about his team being overrated.

That said, don't sleep on the Niners either! They've had one heck of a year themselves, winning 16 games and looking like they belong in the title game. Their defense is downright nasty with Nick Bosa wreaking havoc all season long while Jimmy Garoppolo has shown why he's one of the best QBs in football when healthy.

So where does that leave us? I'm going to go out on a limb here and say Kansas City will come away victorious by around 14 points or so. The reason? That special teams unit for the Chiefs is just too good, plain and simple. They're one of the most explosive units in recent memory - think Tyreek Hill returning kicks for TDs left and right!

And while San Fran has its share of weapons on offense (George Kittle anyone?), I'm not sold that their running game will be able to keep up with Patrick Mahomes' aerial assault. The Chiefs have shown time after time this season they can put up points at will when given half a chance - something which bodes well for KC fans looking ahead toward Sunday night's showdown.

Now, if you're asking yourself "What about the spread?" then let me tell ya – I'm not going to lie to ya folks: The public is all over Kansas City here, but that doesn't mean there isn't value elsewhere in this game! 

In fact, my money would be on San Francisco covering any sort of points if they're given a shot at around 5 or so - simply put, I think their defense will hold up better than people expect against Mahomes' high-powered attack. But don't take it from me; go look at those Vegas odds for yourself and decide whether you want to join the bandwagon or roll with my picks!

Either way though – regardless of who wins come Monday morning - one thing is certain: This will be a classic Super Bowl matchup between two teams that have earned every right to be here. So grab some wings, pour yourself an ice-cold beer (or soda if you prefer), and let's get ready for what promises to be another unforgettable evening in Tampa!

As always though - remember folks – when it comes time to place your bets on this game? You know who has YOUR back: THE RY-GUY. And if that ain't good enough reason alone... I don't know what IS!
