If you haven't been watching, then get your eyes open because the 2026 NFL Championship is going to be one for the books. With so many teams looking to make their mark this year, there's a lot of action on the betting side as well.

I've been analyzing these games with my sharp eye and my 20 years of experience as an official referee in the sport. That being said, let me break down some of the key matchups that will shape the Super Bowl odds for this year. First up is the NFC Championship game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the San Francisco 49ers. Both teams have been performing exceptionally well throughout the season, but I think that the Eagles' defense may prove too strong for the Niners to handle in a close contest.

Now let's take a look at what's going on over in the AFC Championship game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the New England Patriots. The Chiefs have shown us their ability to come back from behind throughout this season, but I'm not sure if they can overcome Bill Belichick's well-oiled machine one more time. This could be a classic matchup of old versus new - Brady vs Mahomes - in what will likely be one of the most exciting games we've seen all year!

Moving onto some other notable matchups outside of these two title fights, there are plenty of opportunities for value bets throughout the playoffs and into the Super Bowl itself. One area where I'm seeing good odds is with underdogs in key playoff games such as the Pittsburgh Steelers against the Tennessee Titans or even the Baltimore Ravens taking on the Cleveland Browns. Both teams have shown some flashes of brilliance this season, but they haven't quite found their footing yet when it comes to making a deep run into the postseason.

As far as my Ry-Guy's Betting Lock goes, I'm putting all my money on the Philadelphia Eagles to win the Super Bowl and cover the spread against whoever they end up facing in the big game. Their offense has been clicking on all cylinders this season, led by quarterback Jalen Hurts who seems unstoppable when he gets his hands on the ball. They also have a defense that can shut down any opponent's attack with ease, which is exactly what you want in order to take home championship glory at the end of it all.

In conclusion, if you're looking for some smart bets going into this year's NFL playoffs and Super Bowl, be sure to keep an eye on those underdogs as well as my personal pick for champion - the Eagles! So grab your snacks, put on your favorite jersey, and get ready for a wild ride through February. This is The Ry-Guy signing off until next time folks.
