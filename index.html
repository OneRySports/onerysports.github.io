    <title>OPENING STRATEGY: The 'Ref's Perspective'. Start by comparing the news to a specific blown call you saw in a high school game 10 years ago. Back when I was still a ref for Friday Night Lights, there was this one game at West Allis Central where I missed what looked like an obvious pass interference on the goal line with under two minutes left. The kid who should've scored just stood there staring at me as if to say "How could you screw this up?" Well, it's Sunday and once again **the refs (or in this case, the Brewers) are making headlines for all the wrong reasons.** | The Ry-Guy</title>

                First up: Members of the Milwaukee Brewers show up to the Packers game at Lambeau Field and are wearing cheeseheads - Yahoo Sports.
Yep, just what we need – baseball players showing up to a football game wearing cheeseheads like they own the joint. It's bad enough they're trying to cash in on our city's NFL glory; now they think it’s cool to wear their opponent's gear? Unbelievable!

And here’s more about it: Members of the Milwaukee Brewers show up to the Packers game at Lambeau Field and are wearing cheeseheads - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
I guess the Brew Crew just loves rubbing it in our faces with this stunt. If you want to support a team, do it right by buying your own tickets – not stealing ours!

Next: High On Life 2’s pre-load now available on Xbox - XboxEra.
Finally, gamers get their fix of “High On Life” again! Let's hope this sequel isn’t as disappointing as the last Brewers season was (we’re looking at you, Yelich and Suter). Pre-load away!

And here’s what Square Enix has to say: SQUARE ENIX UNVEILS NEW TITLES AND TRAILERS IN LATEST NINTENDO DIRECT - Square Enix Press.
Square Enix keeps making us wait for new games, but hey, at least it looks like they finally have something worth playing again! Bring on the trailers and let's see what kind of magic they're cooking up this time around.

Now this one hits close to home: Disney+ Dead: Marvel, Star Wars Broke Confirms Tony Gilroy - Cosmic Book News.
RIP Disney+, you won't be missed by me anyway... especially after seeing those terrible new episodes of “WandaVision” last season! But really? Another streaming service bites the dust? Yeesh, just when we thought things couldn't get any worse for Marvel fans out there.

And finally: Upcoming Marvel movies and shows for 2026 and beyond: Every new MCU release we know about - GamesRadar+.
So now that Disney+ is gone, where do all those future Marvel releases go? I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens next in this crazy world of superheroes... or maybe not. Who knows how long it’ll be before they cancel everything again!
