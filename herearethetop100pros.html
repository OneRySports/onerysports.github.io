As a lifelong sports fan from Mukwonago, I've seen my share of incredible talent come through these ranks.

One prospect that stands out is Milwaukee native and top-rated pitching prospect Aaron Ashby. The right-hander attended Muskego High School before being drafted by the San Diego Padres in 2016. With a fastball touching triple digits, Ashby has the potential to be a future ace for the Padres organization.

Another Wisconsin connection comes from shortstop Nico Hoerner of Madison, who was selected by the Chicago Cubs in the first round of the 2017 draft out of Stanford University. The slick-fielding Hoerner is known for his defensive prowess and ability to make highlight-reel plays at the hot corner. As a lifelong Brewers fan, it's always exciting to see local talent make their mark on the national stage.

While these top prospects will be showcasing their skills in Florida this spring, another group of young athletes will be vying for playing time with Milwaukee's NBA team. Much like the MLB's farm system, the Bucks' G League affiliate in Wisconsin Herd provides a platform for developing future stars under the watchful eye of Head Coach Joe Prunty and General Manager Jon Horst.

Speaking of which, let me tell you about my favorite sports memory - the Instant Replay Game between the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears in 1989. As I watched from my living room in Mukwonago on a cold Sunday afternoon, Majkowski hit Sharpe to beat the Bears, much to Chicago's eternal frustration. It was one of those moments where you just knew it would be talked about for years to come - and sure enough, every time I meet someone who was around back then, they always bring up that game with a smile on their face.

As we look ahead to this upcoming baseball season, I can't help but feel some excitement about what these top 100 prospects might accomplish over the course of their careers. Who knows - maybe one day soon, Aaron Ashby will be pitching in Miller Park or Nico Hoerner could find himself facing off against the Brewers as a member of the Cubs organization?

Until then, I'll be watching closely from my couch here in Mukwonago, enjoying every moment of spring training and keeping an eye out for any young guns making waves during big league camp. After all, as someone who has spent decades officiating basketball games across Wisconsin, I know firsthand how important it is to develop talent early on - whether you're talking about MLB prospects or future NBA stars coming up through the ranks with the Wisconsin Herd.
