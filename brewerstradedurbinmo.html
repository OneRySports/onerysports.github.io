In exchange, the Brewers acquired left-handed starter Kyle Harrison, infielder David Hamilton, and minor league left-hander Shane Drohan.

Harrison is a highly-touted prospect who has been ranked among the top 25 in baseball. He made his debut with the Giants in 2023 and was part of San Francisco’s deal for Rafael Devers last year. Harrison has shown promise in the minors, posting a 3.39 ERA over more than 350 innings while striking out an impressive 13.7 batters per nine innings.

Hamilton is a versatile defender who can play both second base and shortstop. He had a solid season in 2024, hitting .248/.303/.395 (96 OPS+) and earning 2.6 bWAR. However, he struggled in the shortened 2025 campaign due to injury.

Drohan is a left-handed pitcher who has yet to make his major league debut. He had an excellent showing at Triple-A Worcester last year when healthy, posting a 2.27 ERA and striking out more than a batter per inning.

The trade leaves the Brewers with a question mark at third base, as Durbin was their starting third baseman in 2025 and appeared to be part of the team’s future plans. Monasterio had been a reliable utility infielder for the past three seasons, while Seigler showed some promise despite a disappointing first year in the majors.

The Brewers will now need to determine who their starting third baseman will be on opening day as they prepare for another season of competition.
