Okay, so the last couple of those sexual assault lawsuits against Deshaun Watson have been thrown out? Huh. Well, let's not get too excited yet. Two down, but there are still more pending cases to go through. The NFL is going to be all over this one way or another. They don't want their franchise QB getting tarnished by allegations of assaulting women masseuses and others during his time with the Browns. 

I'll believe it when I see it. Watson's got a history of making questionable decisions, from his college days at Clemson to now. And let's be real - there are more than enough reasons for those plaintiffs to take legal action if they feel wronged. One thing about sports is that when you're dealing with powerful figures like NFL stars, the truth can be hard to come by. 

That said, I'm not one of these "cancel culture" types. If Watson is guilty as charged in some or all of these cases, he needs to face consequences. But if he's innocent and these are just a bunch of opportunistic women looking for fame and money - well, that's wrong too. The legal system should sort it out without the media circus and public outrage getting involved. 

In any event, Watson better be on his best behavior going forward once this is all settled. He can't afford another scandal like this one if he wants to remain in the good graces of the Browns organization and have a long NFL career. One positive outcome could be that other teams are more careful about how they handle their high-profile players moving forward. 

*The Ry-Guy sips his beer* Well, I'll keep my eyes on Watson's case. But for now, I've got the Packers game to watch in a few hours and some Madden 23 matches to get in with the boys later. That's where I find true satisfaction - on the court or in my man cave cheering on Wisconsin sports!
