I've been doing this long enough to know these preseason projections are about as reliable as a deer in headlights when the lights come on! 

Let me break it down like a ref breaking up an alley-oop play. You're gonna see some top relief pitchers ranked highly - guys like Ryan Pressly, Emilio Pagán and Josh Hader. They'll be touted for their high strikeout rates and dominant stuff. But here's the rub - bullpen roles are fluid as heck in real life. A pitcher can get hurt, lose his closer role or just flat out suck it up. 

The rankings will also overvalue some guys with good peripherals but poor results last year. Like Shane Greene or Brad Hand. They'll get ranked based on their K/9 and BB/9 rates, not the actual saves and blown saves they actually delivered!

And don't even get me started on the sleepers - guys like Daniel Bard or Ryan Brasier who come back from injury and suddenly look like world beaters again. The rankings always overlook those comeback kids until it's too late to snag 'em in your drafts. 

So my advice? Take these preseason relief pitcher rankings with a grain of salt, just like you would when a ref makes a bad call on the court. Focus on guys who actually perform week-to-week and can get you wins in your league. That's what matters most!

*grins* Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta check out these preseason rankings for my own fantasy leagues... but don't be surprised when they're totally inaccurate come opening day! In the words of Ray Allen after that infamous Bucks/Sixers series: "It's all about execution!"
