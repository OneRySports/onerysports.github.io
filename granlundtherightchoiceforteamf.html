It is with great excitement that I, The Ry-Guy, announce my endorsement of the decision to name Mikko Granlund as the captain for Team Finland at this year's Winter Olympics in PyeongChang. This move speaks volumes about the direction and leadership qualities within the Finnish hockey program.

Granlund has been a key figure on the ice for both his club team and country, displaying a rare combination of skill, intelligence, and determination. His ability to control the pace of play and make crucial decisions under pressure makes him an ideal candidate to lead Team Finland into battle against some of the best in the world.

I believe that having Granlund as captain will provide stability on the ice while allowing other players to shine around him. He sets a high standard for himself, pushing those around him to perform at their absolute best. In addition, his experience playing in the NHL has given him valuable insights into how to compete against top-level competition, which will benefit Team Finland significantly during these upcoming games.

One thing that stands out about Granlund is his work ethic and commitment to improving every day. As a media mogul who understands what it takes to achieve greatness both on and off the ice, I can assure you that he embodies those qualities perfectly. With him leading the charge, Team Finland has a real shot at bringing home gold for their country.

Now let's talk about some betting lines surrounding this matchup:

Team Finland vs Russia in quarterfinals -150 (odds)
Russia +3.5 goals over/under 7

Based on my analysis of recent performances and statistical trends, I am putting all my chips on Team Finland to win this match by at least four goals or more. The fact that they have such an experienced captain like Granlund leading the charge only adds fuel to fire when it comes down to making smart bets here. 

Not only does Granlund possess exceptional hockey skills but also knows how to lead from the front, which is crucial in high-pressure situations like these Olympics games. With his guidance and leadership qualities combined with Finland's strong roster depth, they should be able to outplay Russia both offensively and defensively throughout this entire game series.

In conclusion, I am thrilled about Mikko Granlund being named captain for Team Finland at the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang. His experience, work ethic, and leadership qualities make him an ideal choice to lead his team into battle against some of the best players in the world. As a media mogul who understands what it takes to succeed both on and off the ice, I am confident that he will be able to guide Team Finland towards victory during these upcoming games.
