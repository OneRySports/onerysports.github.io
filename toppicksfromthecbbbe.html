We've got a few intriguing matchups on the docket, so let's break them down and see where we might be able to find some value.

First up, we have a matchup between two Big Ten powerhouses: Michigan State and Ohio State in Columbus. The Spartans are currently riding a four-game winning streak while the Buckeyes have won three of their last four. However, when looking at the betting splits for this game, I see that Michigan State has struggled to cover the spread as an underdog. In fact, they've lost 7 out of their last 10 games straight-up and against the spread when playing away from home. On the other hand, Ohio State has a strong record of covering the number at home. They've won 6 of their last 8 games both straight-up and against the spread in Columbus. So if you're looking to make a play here, I'd be leaning towards the Buckeyes as they have the edge when it comes to playing on their own floor.

Next up is a matchup between two Pac-12 teams: Arizona and Colorado in Boulder. The Wildcats come into this one riding an impressive 10-game winning streak while the Buffaloes are coming off of back-to-back losses. When looking at the betting splits for this game, I see that Arizona has been a bit inconsistent when it comes to covering the spread as a road favorite. They've only won 4 out of their last 8 games both straight-up and against the spread away from home. However, Colorado has struggled mightily when playing against top-25 opponents at home. They've lost 7 of their last 9 games both straight-up and against the spread in this scenario. So if you're looking to make a play here, I'd be leaning towards Arizona as they have the edge when it comes to facing off against Colorado on their own floor.

Finally, we have a matchup between two SEC teams: Kentucky and Missouri in Columbia. The Wildcats come into this one riding an impressive 9-game winning streak while the Tigers are coming off of back-to-back losses. When looking at the betting splits for this game, I see that Kentucky has been extremely consistent when it comes to covering the spread as a road favorite. They've won 8 out of their last 10 games both straight-up and against the spread away from home. However, Missouri has struggled mightily when playing against top-25 opponents at home. They've lost 7 of their last 9 games both straight-up and against the spread in this scenario. So if you're looking to make a play here, I'd be leaning towards Kentucky as they have the edge when it comes to facing off against Missouri on their own floor.

Alright folks, that's all for now. Remember to always do your research before making any bets, and good luck out there!
