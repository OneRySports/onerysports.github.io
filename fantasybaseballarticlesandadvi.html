The text you mentioned couldn't be extracted. However, in general terms, I'd say:

FantasyPros is a go-to site for sharp bettors like myself when it comes to fantasy sports content. They offer expert analysis, rankings, projections and strategy tips to help maximize your ROI in daily fantasy contests and keeper leagues. 

The key for me as a ref with 20 years of experience and a keen eye for betting value is that FantasyPros provides insights based on advanced metrics and statistical models, not just gut feelings or hype. Their articles break down player values based on expected stats like wRC+ for hitters and fWAR for pitchers. They also emphasize situational factors - matchups against certain pitching types, weather conditions affecting hitters, etc.

If I were to choose a "Ry-Guy's Betting Lock" from their fantasy baseball advice, it would be taking advantage of the discrepancy between public perception and the numbers when it comes to players on hot streaks. FantasyPros often highlights that the average Joe in the office pool tends to overvalue guys like Mike Trout or Shohei Ohtani simply because they're stars. But if you dig into the underlying stats, there might be more value elsewhere. 

For example, say Trout is mashing and everyone's piling onto him for their DFS lineups. Meanwhile a guy like Corey Dickerson has been quietly cranking homers against lefties but is still available in 30% of leagues because he lacks star power. FantasyPros would likely have projections showing Dickerson as the better value play that week given his matchup and recent performance, despite Trout's reputation. That's the kind of betting angle I love - finding mispriced assets based on numbers vs. perception. 

The key takeaway is to use sites like FantasyPros for their data-driven approach rather than chasing narratives. Look at projected stats relative to salary in DFS, or projected rankings vs. draft position in keeper leagues. And always be skeptical of the "obvious" picks that everyone else is taking - there's usually value hiding underneath if you do your homework based on advanced metrics and situational factors.
