            *sigh*. Another day in the land of cheese and consoles as we’re forced to sit through yet another article claiming that Nintendo’s new Switch can handle AAA games better than people think.*roll eyes at this “news” story, while simultaneously scrolling past it on my phone during a Packers game. What next? They’ll tell us that the Badgers actually have a shot in the Big Ten Championship Game*! 

At least we know one thing for certain – no matter how hard they try to sell their new hardware as something more than what people think, there will always be those who refuse to let go of outdated notions. I mean sure*, maybe this time around Nintendo has managed not only up its graphical capabilities but also improved upon some other aspects like battery life or storage space?* But hey**, if it ain’t broke (or at least** broken enough) then why fix what isn't necessarily all that bad to begin with*. 

And let's face facts here folks: no matter how much better this new Switch supposedly is compared against its predecessor, you’re still playing on a device designed by the same company responsible for creating those weirdly shaped controllers and quirky characters like Wario. So while I’ll give them credit where it’s due*, don't expect me to believe they've suddenly become masters of AAA gaming overnight*. 

All things considered though**, maybe we should focus less* on whether or not Nintendo can handle these big-budget titles (pun intended)***, and instead just enjoy what makes their games unique in the first place - namely that quirky charm combined with gameplay mechanics designed to make everyone feel included no matter your skill level. Because let's be real here folks**: if you really wanted a system capable of running Crysis 5 perfectly then why wouldn't* you opt for something like an Xbox Series X instead?

So while I won’t deny the fact that Nintendo’s new Switch might just surprise us all when it comes to handling some AAA titles, let's not get carried away with expectations here. Afterall*, in Wisconsin we know better than anyone else how quickly things can go from looking promising*** right back into mediocrity again - ask any Green Bay Packers fan about last season*!
