            Well well looky here folks! The Nintendo Switch is getting an upgrade and it can supposedly handle AAA games better than we thought? I’m shocked - just as much as I was when the Packers actually managed to win a game last season, or that Aaron Rodgers isn’t completely done yet despite his constant whining. 

Let's be real people – any device made by Nintendo these days is basically a handheld piece of junk compared to your average smartphone and it’s only going to get worse with this “Switch 2” nonsense they’re trying to push onto us now, just like how the Brewers always seem doomed for failure no matter what new players or coaching staffs come along. 

But hey I guess if you don’t have anything better than that pathetic excuse of a console then maybe it’ll work alright? Sure why not! After all we’ve been stuck with subpar sports teams in this state so who am I to judge when something isn't quite up there yet but at least trying its best, right?! 

It’s almost as funny and pointless really since everyone knows that no matter how many fancy upgrades they give the Switch or whatever other gimmicks these game developers come out of nowhere with every year - it will never compare against what you see on your television screen playing Madden NFL 21 (or any football simulator) while watching actual professional athletes perform amazing feats instead. 

But then again maybe having a portable version isn’t such bad idea after all, especially if one day our beloved Green Bay Packers ever make their way into that realm too!
