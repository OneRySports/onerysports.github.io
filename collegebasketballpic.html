As always, I've done my homework and got a few solid bets that I think will pay off big time. But before we dive in, it's important to remember the history behind this great sport. The Green Bay Packers might be the kings of football, but college hoops has its own storied past too.

Now let's get down to business - these are my best bets for Tuesday, February 10th:

Wisconsin Badgers +3 vs. Purdue Boilermakers
The Badgers have been playing lights out this season and I think they're going to continue that trend tonight against the Boilermakers. Coach Bo Ryan has got his squad clicking on all cylinders and I love their chances in this one despite being slight underdogs.

Kentucky Wildcats -10 vs. Georgia Bulldogs
The 'Cats are rolling right now, with a high-powered offense led by big man Karl Anthony Towns. They're going to be tough for the Bulldogs to contain tonight. I'm laying the points and taking UK in this one.

Villanova Wildcats +5 vs. Georgetown Hoyas
This is a classic Big East matchup between two of the conference's best teams. But while Georgetown has been playing well, Villanova looks like they're on the verge of breaking out into something special with the emergence of JayVaughn Pinkston. I'm liking their chances as underdogs tonight in Washington D.C.

Those are my three top college basketball picks for today - February 10th. Like any good bettor knows, these things don't always work out perfectly, but I've got a lot of confidence in this group! So take it easy out there and remember to gamble responsibly, people.
