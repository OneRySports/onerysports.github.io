We've got a loaded slate of games on this Tuesday night, and Peterson is laying out his best bets for us at VSiN. 

First up, we've got a key ACC matchup between Duke and NC State in Durham. The Blue Devils are red-hot right now, winning their last 6 games by an average of almost 20 points per game! They're a well-rounded team that can score inside with Kyle Filipowski and from deep with Jeremy Roach. Meanwhile, the Wolfpack have been up and down all season - they're not as consistent as Duke. I'm taking Duke here to cover the spread.

Next, we've got a West Coast Conference showdown between BYU and Saint Mary's in San Francisco. This is always a fun game with two physical teams that know how to play defense. The Cougars are led by big man Caleb Lohner while the Gaels have their own monster inside in Logan Johnson. It should be a tight one, but I'm leaning towards Saint Mary's here - they've been playing some of their best basketball lately and have the edge at home.

Then we've got an SEC tilt between Kentucky and Tennessee on national TV. The Wildcats are rolling right now with a 9-game win streak! They're a high-flying offense led by Cason Wallace that can really get it going in transition. The Volunteers will give them a good challenge, but UK has too much firepower for UT to handle over the course of a game. Kentucky is my favorite here to cover.

So there you have it - Duke at home against NC State, Saint Mary's hosting BYU, and Kentucky traveling to take on Tennessee are all worth considering from Greg Peterson's best bets today! Let me know what you think in the comments below. 

And hey Packers fans, did you know that before the modern NFL championship game existed, the Packers actually won their first title by record back in 1929? Talk about proving Wisconsin was the center of the football world way before Lambeau Field was even built! Those are the types of things that make me proud to be a fan.

Alright everyone, let's get out there and enjoy some hoops tonight - may your brackets be ever in your favor!
