I've got a keen eye for the game from my days as a ref in high school and D3 ball - you can't fool me when it comes to spotting the value on the boards or at the free throw line.

My number one play today is East Tennessee State at 140 against Chattanooga (-160). The Buccaneers are coming off two straight losses but should bounce back strong in this Southern Conference showdown. ETSU has the superior defense, allowing just under 57 points per game on the season while holding their last three opponents to under 50%. They've also been a reliable free throw shooting team from the line at 68%, which will come into play against Chattanooga's below average 3-point defense.

As for the Mocs, they are riding high after beating Furman on Saturday but this is a tougher matchup. Chattanooga hasn't covered in four of their last five games and they have struggled mightily with foul trouble down the stretch of close contests. I expect ETSU to keep it close all night long before pulling away for the win.

My second play today is an underdog spot on Illinois State at 145 against Valparaiso (-190). The Redbirds are coming off a tough loss but they've shown enough in this Missouri Valley Conference season that I think they can make things interesting tonight. Illinois State has been one of the best defensive teams in the MVC, holding opponents to just under 67 points per game on average and shooting over 45% from downtown themselves when needed most.

As for Valpo, while they've won four straight games entering this contest it's hard not to take notice that three of those wins came against sub-.500 teams during conference play. The Crusaders are also prone to foul trouble down the stretch which could open up easy buckets from Illinois State if things get chippy late in regulation or overtime (if it goes there).

So there you have it - my best bets for today's college basketball action based on all of my experience watching and officiating this great game. Remember folks, these are just educated guesses and anything can happen when these teams hit the floor tonight! Good luck with your picks and let me know how they shake out later on.
