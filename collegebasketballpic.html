I've been around the block a few times, from my days as a hard-nosed NBA ref to my love of all things Wisconsin sports and gaming. So let me break down these games with the same sharp eye I use when calling a foul or spotting a good bet.

First up, we have a Big Ten clash between the Wisconsin Badgers and Purdue Boilermakers in Madison. The Badgers are riding high after some impressive performances, but they'll need to bring their A-game against a talented Purdue squad. Look for Badgers big man Tyler Wahl to anchor down low while key perimeter threats like Johnny Davis and Chucky Hepburn find open looks from the outside. I expect this one to be tight throughout, so keep your eyes on the defensive boards - whoever controls the glass will win.

Next up is a Showtime battle between UCLA Bruins and USC Trojans in Los Angeles. These teams are locked in a heated rivalry atop the Pac-12 standings. The Bruins have been red-hot of late behind the playmaking of Jaime Jaquez Jr., while the Trojans rely on their athleticism and defense to win games. This matchup will come down to which team can handle the pressure better - my money is on UCLA's veteran leadership guiding them to victory in a close one.

Finally, we've got an ACC showdown between Duke Blue Devils and North Carolina Tar Heels at Cameron Indoor Stadium. The home crowd will be raucous as these two longtime rivals square off. The Heels have been rolling with their high-flying offense led by Armando Bacot down low, while the Blue Devils are a veteran squad that thrives in big moments. Look for Duke to use their experience and depth to weather any second-half storm from North Carolina.

There you have it - my best bets for Tuesday's college hoops action. Remember folks, just like calling a tight game on the court or making a smart bet at the Sharp table, success comes down to preparation, execution and heart. Now go out there and win some games!
