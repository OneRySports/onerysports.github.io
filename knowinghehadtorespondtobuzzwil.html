Facing pressure from head coach Buzz Williams, who called out the team's performance during halftime of their previous game, the Maryland guard stepped up and led his team to a 67-62 victory at Williams Arena on Saturday. 

Coit finished with 18 points, including several clutch shots down the stretch that helped secure the win for the Terrapins (9-5 overall; 4-3 Big Ten). The redshirt sophomore guard has been instrumental in helping Maryland navigate through a challenging early conference schedule that includes losses to top-ranked Purdue and fifth-ranked Indiana.

Minnesota (7-8 overall; 2-6 Big Ten) had the chance to take control of the game late, but struggled from the free throw line down the stretch. The Golden Gophers missed five of their last seven free throws in the final minute, allowing Maryland to capitalize and extend its lead. 

Williams' halftime speech seemed to be just what his team needed as they entered the second half with a renewed sense of urgency. After a slow start, the Terrapins outscored Minnesota 38-27 in the second half behind Coit's strong performance.

While this win will do wonders for Maryland's confidence moving forward, there is still plenty of work to be done if they hope to reach their goal of competing for a Big Ten title and a deep NCAA tournament run. However, Coit's ability to rise to the occasion when his team needed him most bodes well for their future prospects.

Ry-Guy's Betting Lock:
With both teams struggling with consistency so far this season, it's hard to say what we can expect from either side moving forward in conference play. That being said, I would be cautious about taking any significant risks on either Maryland or Minnesota until they prove themselves more reliable over an extended period of time.

However, if you're looking for a solid bet based solely on performance thus far this season, consider laying points against Indiana when these two teams meet later this month in College Park. The Hoosiers have been dominant so far this year and are currently ranked fifth in the nation. They should be able to cover any reasonable number against either Maryland or Minnesota given their superior talent level at all positions on both sides of the ball.
