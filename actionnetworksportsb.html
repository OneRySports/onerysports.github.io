I've got some serious analysis on today's betting lines from Action Network. As a sharp bettor with over two decades of experience in the trenches as both a basketball ref and a father to two rambunctious kids, let me break down what you need to know before putting your money where your mouth is.

First off, I'm seeing some interesting numbers on the Packers game today. Green Bay looks like they're primed for a big one after that brutal 2014 season when we blew a 16-0 lead in Seattle thanks to an absolute nightmare of an onside kick attempt. That was a low point for sure, but this team has come together under Aaron Rodgers and is ready to make some noise.

I'm seeing the Packers listed as favorites by about three points against the Colts today. Now that may seem like a lot, but consider who we're talking about here - it's Green Bay! We've got one of the most explosive offenses in football with Jordy Nelson leading the way and a defense that can shut down just about anyone when they put their minds to it.

But let me tell you something else - I know how these betting lines work because I've been around long enough to see them go up and down like a yo-yo on a basketball rim. Sometimes they're right, sometimes they're not so much... but there's always an edge if you look hard enough for it.

One thing that gives me pause about this line is the fact that we'll be playing without Clay Matthews today due to injury. He might just be our best linebacker and his absence could really hurt us against Andrew Luck and that Colts offense. That said, I still like the Packers in this one - they're hungry after last year's disappointment and they know what it takes to win big games when everything is on the line.

So where do I think you should put your money? If I had to pick a side right now, I'd say go with Green Bay at around +300 or so depending on how much action comes across these boards later today. But don't take my word for it - do your own research and make sure you're comfortable with whatever decision you end up making because betting is all about confidence in yourself first and foremost!

In conclusion, while there are certainly risks involved here as always when putting down cash on sporting events like this one between the Packers and Colts today, I think we have a real shot at pulling off another victory against our division rivals. Whether or not you decide to join me in backing them remains entirely up to each individual bettor out there - just make sure whatever choice you ultimately go with is based upon solid reasoning rather than emotion alone!
