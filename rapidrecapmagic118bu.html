The win streak is over  

Well, well, well—look who got their bell rung in Orlando! The Bucks’ hot streak went from “holy smokes” to “whoa there” faster than Aaron Rodgers shaking off a hit back when he was still waiting for his shot in Green Bay. If you’re not keeping score at home (and let’s be real, you should’ve been), the Magic dropped Milwaukee like it was a bad matchup on DraftKings: 118-99. Oof.  

Kevin Porter Jr., our man KPJ, tried to carry the load with 28 points, seven assists, and four boards—like that one dad trying to fix everything with duct tape while his kids are crying in the backseat. Meanwhile, Anthony Black (and yes, Franz Wagner, making his return after an ankle injury) dropped 26 points each for Orlando like it was Tuesday afternoon trivia night. The Magic went from “yikes” to “holy smokes,” and suddenly the Bucks were watching their lead evaporate quicker than a snow cone in July.  

The first quarter? Let’s just say both teams looked more confused than my kids after a long day of gaming—combined 10 turnovers, 21 missed shots, and buckets fewer than a three-point shot from the free-throw line (yes, I’ve been watching too many refs). But when Franz Wagner hit the floor, everything changed. He scored twice in transition like he was playing Mario Kart on easy mode, and suddenly Orlando’s offense had more rhythm than my daughter’s TikTok dances.  

Then came Cam Thomas—looking sharp as hell in those “Kobe Grinch shoes” (who knew a Bucks player could pull off a Christmas vibe this hard?)—and the Bucks tied things up at 31. But Black got into his bag, dropping triples and nearly blowing up the rim like he was auditioning for The Avengers’ next stunt double. Rollins and Green hit some threes to keep Milwaukee in it, but by half-time, Orlando was shooting bricks from deep (4/21 from three-point land). Still, the Magic were clinging to a 54-51 lead—like that one team you’ve seen in Madden who just won’t quit.  

The third quarter? Let’s call it the “Blackout.” Porter, Turner, and Green kept the Bucks within two points (64-66), but Black went on a tear with a smooth fake Euro-step move so slick it’d make Kyrie Irving blush. Then Moe Wagner, Franz again, and rookie Jase Richardson started hitting threes like they were playing NBA 2K on All-Star difficulty—from ghastly to glorious in one quarter (6/11 from deep). Suddenly, the Magic had a 87-74 lead, and Milwaukee was looking more confused than my Wi-Fi after I yelled at it for lagging.  

The fourth? Yeah, let’s just say Cam Thomas got some points early, but Black answered with a 6-0 run capped by an alley-oop so “super dope” you’d think he stole moves from Luke Skywalker himself. From there, the game was all Orlando—like they were playing on “Easy Mode.” And hey, at least we saw Ousmane Dieng drop a bucket in garbage time like it was his last shot ever (spoiler: it wasn’t).  

Stat that Stood Out? The Bucks took 77 shots to Orlando’s 86 and had 19 turnovers versus the Magic’s 11. And while we’re at it, let’s not forget those 11 offensive rebounds for Orlando compared to Milwaukee’s six. Maybe if they’d stopped giving away possession like free samples at Costco, this could’ve been a different story.  

But hey—at least the Bucks didn’t get blown out by 30 points like my fantasy team did last week after I overpaid for a “sleeper” pick. Still… yikes. Let’s hope next time they remember: in basketball—and in life—turnovers are worse than spilled milk on your favorite couch.  

Until then, stay sharp. And maybe trade some Bucks stock while you’re at it.
