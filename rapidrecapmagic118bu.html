The Bucks' win streak is over, and it wasn't pretty. They got absolutely torched by the Orlando Magic in a game that was more like a circus than a basketball match. 

The first quarter was a mess for both teams, with way too many turnovers and missed shots. But then Franz Wagner came back from his injury and things took a turn for the worse. He scored twice right away and got everyone moving faster, making it easier for the Magic to score.

Cam Thomas entered the game wearing some wild shoes (Kobe Grinch, I think?), but that didn't help the Bucks much. Anthony Black went off with multiple triples and near-dunks, putting them ahead by eight points. The Bucks managed to stay close thanks to some threes from Rollins and Green, but they were still down at halftime.

The third quarter was more of the same until the Magic finally started hitting their three-pointers again after being terrible in the first half. They went on a 7-2 run that put them up by double digits, and then things just got worse from there. Cam Thomas scored his first points as a Buck in garbage time, but it was too little too late.

The stat that stood out to me is how badly the Bucks were beaten at the possession game - they shot 77 shots compared to Orlando's 86! And with all those turnovers (19 for Milwaukee), it's no wonder they lost so handily. 

So there you have it folks, another loss for the Bucks and yet another reminder that even when your team is hot, anything can happen on any given night in this crazy world of professional basketball.
