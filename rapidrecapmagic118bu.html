The final score was 118-99 in favor of the Magic, ending the Bucks’ three-game winning streak and dropping their record to 32-47.

Kevin Porter Jr. led the charge for Milwaukee with a strong performance, scoring 28 points along with seven assists and four rebounds. However, it wasn’t enough to overcome the Magic’s impressive effort on both ends of the court. Anthony Black was the standout performer for Orlando, putting up 26 points and five boards while leading his team to victory.

The game started off slow, with both teams struggling offensively in the first quarter. The Bucks had seven turnovers compared to three for the Magic, but they managed to keep it close despite multiple missed shots from deep. However, when Franz Wagner entered the game after recovering from an ankle injury, he quickly changed the pace of play and helped Orlando take control.

Cam Thomas made his debut with the Bucks in this matchup, sporting some flashy Kobe Grinch shoes that caught everyone’s attention. He played well early on but couldn’t find consistent offense throughout the night. The Magic continued to build their lead as they hit crucial threes down the stretch of the second quarter, putting them ahead by 41-33 at halftime despite shooting poorly from beyond the arc earlier in the game (only 4/21).

In the third quarter, both teams traded baskets back and forth until Orlando went on a decisive run that put them up by double digits. They improved their three-point shooting significantly during this stretch (6/11), allowing them to extend their lead to 87-74 after three quarters of play.

The fourth quarter saw Cam Thomas finally get some buckets under his belt as he started scoring for the first time since halftime, but it was too little too late. Anthony Black continued his hot streak with a personal six-point run that included an impressive alley-oop finish. From there, Orlando cruised to victory while the Bucks struggled to find any semblance of rhythm or consistency on offense.

Overall, this game highlighted some concerning issues for Milwaukee moving forward into playoff contention season. Turnovers and defensive breakdowns plagued them throughout the night, leading to a lackluster performance that resulted in their first loss since February 26th against Cleveland Cavaliers. With only four games remaining before playoffs begin next week, these Bucks must find ways to tighten up their game if they hope to make any noise come playoff time this season.
