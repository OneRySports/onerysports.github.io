The Magic ended the Bucks' win streak with a blowout victory of 118-99. Kevin Porter Jr. led the Bucks in scoring with 28 points, seven assists, and four rebounds, while Anthony Black had a standout performance for the Magic with 26 points and five boards.

The first quarter was not great for either team, as they struggled with turnovers and missed shots. The Bucks had seven turnovers alone. However, Franz Wagner made his return from injury in this game and played a key role in helping the Magic take control of the game. His quick scoring helped put Orlando ahead by eight points after one quarter, despite Kevin Porter Jr.'s bomb at the end of the period that cut the lead to five.

In the second quarter, Cam Thomas entered the game wearing some eye-catching Kobe Grinch shoes and the Bucks got back into it with buckets from Bobby Portis. But then Anthony Black took over for Orlando, dropping multiple triples and nearly detonating at the rim to put them ahead by eight points midway through the period. The Bucks responded with threes from Rollins and Green to stay close, but the Magic's poor shooting from deep allowed Milwaukee to take a three-point lead at halftime.

The third quarter saw both teams trading baskets back-and-forth until Anthony Black made his move for Orlando again, going on a personal 7-2 run that included an impressive fake euro-step layup. The Magic then started hitting threes more consistently and blew the game open with six triples in the period alone - four from Wagner and two from Moe Harkless - putting them up by double digits heading into the fourth quarter.

In the final frame, Anthony Black continued his hot streak with another 6-0 run including an alley-oop off the sideline out of bounds to extend their lead further. From there it was all Orlando as they cruised to victory. On a positive note for Milwaukee though, we did get to see Ousmane Dieng make some buckets in garbage time.

In terms of stats that stood out during this game, the Bucks got beaten at possession rate shooting 77 shots compared to Orlando's 86 attempts which included more turnovers (19 vs 11). Additionally, Orlando had double-digit offensive rebounds (11) versus Milwaukee's six.
