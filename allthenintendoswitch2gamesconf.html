                *sips coffee, scowls at computer screen* Another day in the life of The Ry-Guy here - reporting on all things Nintendo Switch while sweltering away under this oppressive heat wave we're having out west near Mukwonago! I'm not sure if it's hotter than hell or just another scorching summer afternoon. Either way, my brain feels like a melted Popsicle when trying to focus long enough for coherent thoughts about the next generation of handhelds...

But hey - who am *I* kidding? Nintendo knows what they're doing! They've got their little fans eating outta' da hand every time with these new consoles and games. And look at 'em now: "All The Nintendo Switch 2 Games (Confirmed & Rumored) So Far". Yeah, because we all can't get enough of rumors that may or may not pan out in the end...

I mean sure - there's always excitement around a brand-new gaming platform coming down da line. But let me tell ya', after years and years of hearing about "the next big thing" from Nintendo themselves (and every other company for dat matter), I've started to believe that maybe none o' it actually exists until you stick your hand in one's pocketbook, so ta speak...

So what do we have here? A list filled with names like Metroid Dread 2: The Final Countdown or some such nonsense. And don't even get me started on how many times "rumored" appears next to those titles! It makes my eyes water just thinking about it - not unlike when I'm stuck outside in this muggy Mukwonago weather, trying desperately ta avoid being consumed by humidity and mosquitos alike...

But hey – that's what passes for entertainment these days. People love their rumors like they do their gossip at the local barber shop back home near Milwaukee county line or whatever it is now since city boundaries keep changing every year under new mayors' policies anyway! So long as there are more pixels being pushed into our faces, we'll continue to gobble up any tidbit thrown in front of us...

And then comes another announcement about the next big thing from Nintendo themselves. It's almost like clockwork now: tease something just enough ta keep ya coming back for mo', but never quite give away anything substantial until launch day (if ever). But hey - at least they know how to sell a product! And who am *I* anyway? Just some cynical sports writer trying his best notta get sucked into the vortex of consumerism and hype cycles that plague our modern world...

So there you have it folks – another entry in The Ry-Guy's chronicles on life, love (or lack thereof), weather near Mukwonago Wisconsin during these tumultuous times. Stay tuned for more musings as they happen!
