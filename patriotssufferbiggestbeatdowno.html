The final score was 34-0 in favor of the Seahawks, marking just the second time in franchise history that they've been shut out in a Super Bowl game and the first since 1985 when they lost to the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field by a score of 61-7.

The Patriots entered this game as heavy favorites but were completely dominated from start to finish. The Seahawks defense was on fire all night, sacking Tom Brady seven times while also forcing him into multiple turnovers and mistakes that ultimately led to Seattle's offensive touchdowns. Meanwhile, their own running back Marshawn Lynch had an incredible performance with over 100 rushing yards and two scores under his belt before halftime even ended!

As for New England's offense? Well...it never really got going at all during this game. Tom Brady threw three interceptions (including one which was returned for a touchdown) while also fumbling twice on top of that; however, what really hurt him was when he lost his composure after being hit hard near midfield following an incomplete pass attempt deep downfield late in the third quarter - resulting in another turnover via fumble recovery by Seattle's Kam Chancellor who then rumbled up field into Patriot territory before eventually settling out around their own 20-yard line where they would later score again shortly thereafter thanks to some shaky coverage from New England's secondary unit led by Devin McCourty and Patrick Chung alike.

In contrast, Russell Wilson had one of his best performances ever as a pro athlete playing under center tonight against Bill Belichick's team - completing 20 out of 30 passes for 241 yards plus three passing touchdowns along with no turnovers whatsoever throughout the entire contest! His connection with Doug Baldwin proved too much to handle since they connected on multiple occasions leading directly towards points scored via TDs including one particular play-action fake handoff designed perfectly so Wilson could step up into pocket space where he found Baldwin wide open downfield who then turned it into six more points before halftime concluded.

The loss was particularly tough for the Patriots as it ended their bid to win a third straight Super Bowl title, something that had never been done before in NFL history until now. With this defeat, they also dropped below .500 on the season with just one game remaining against Buffalo Bills next week which will determine whether or not they make playoffs at all come January 2019 when AFC Championship game is set to take place between top two teams from conference standings - currently being led by Kansas City Chiefs who are looking like favorites heading into postseason play despite having lost some key players over course of regular season such as Travis Kelce and Tyreek Hill both suffering injuries which could impact their chances going forward.

Overall, the Seahawks did what many thought was impossible by defeating a team that has won two championships in three years - but more importantly, they proved to themselves and everyone else watching worldwide that Seattle can compete with anyone at any time when given opportunity; especially against an opponent like New England who have become synonymous with success throughout 2017 campaign so far.
