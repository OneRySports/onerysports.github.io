With the regular season coming to a close and playoff races heating up across all of our major leagues - it's time for us to buckle down and put together those winning lineups. And let me tell you, there are some intriguing matchups out there that could make or break your campaign come Sunday.

First off, let's talk about the NFL. I'm seeing a few teams who seem poised to cover their spreads this week, and it has everything to do with mismatches in terms of talent and strategy on both sides of the ball. The New Orleans Saints are coming off an impressive win against the Carolina Panthers last weekend, but they'll need to keep their foot on the gas pedal if they want to continue their push for playoff contention. On paper, this looks like a tough matchup against the Atlanta Falcons at home - however, I'm taking the underdogs in this one because I believe that New Orleans can exploit weaknesses in their opponents' defense while containing any potential threats on offense from Matt Ryan and Co.

As far as baseball goes, we have several divisional battles heating up across Major League Baseball. The Milwaukee Brewers are leading the pack in the National League Central division by two games over second place Chicago Cubs. While I'm not necessarily picking against either team this week - there's one game that stands out to me: The St Louis Cardinals host Cincinnati Reds at Busch Stadium on Tuesday night. Both teams have had their ups and downs throughout the season, but right now they sit just three games behind first place Los Angeles Dodgers in what could be a wild race down stretch run of regular season play. That being said, I think St Louis will come out swinging when these two meet head-to-head under the bright lights inside Busch Stadium on Tuesday night.
