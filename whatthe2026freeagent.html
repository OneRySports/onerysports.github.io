With limited cap space and some key positions needing attention, one spot that would be at the top of their list if they were able to make a move is cornerback. The team's current group of corners isn't terrible, but it isn't great either. In fact, Keisean Nixon and Carrington Valentine hover around average, while Nate Hobbs is on the border between average and below-average according to yards allowed per coverage snap data from NFL Pro.

That being said, there are some talented cornerbacks available in the upcoming free agent class who could help improve Green Bay's secondary. However, the Packers haven't really been known for dipping into the well-aged market at a position like cornerback where athleticism is so important. Generally speaking, if a player is older than 27 years old, they are probably out of the running in Green Bay because the team likes to lock down their starters on multi-year deals.

So with that in mind, let's take a look at some of the younger cornerbacks who might be available in the 2026 free agency class:

Eric Stokes - Las Vegas Raiders
Stokes is a former first-round pick out of the Packers' own draft back in 2021. After being traded to the Raiders, he had a huge jump in production last year and finished with the best yards per coverage snap allowed among all corners who played significant snaps in 2025. Stokes was originally drafted by Green Bay to play in their quarters-based system under Joe Barry which is similar to what new defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon deploys now. If there's mutual interest, perhaps Stokes could find his way back home to Wisconsin and reunite with the team that drafted him.

Tariq Woolen - Seattle Seahawks
Woolen has been one of the most consistent producers among younger corners over the past couple of seasons. A big physical corner at 6'4", 210 pounds, he led the NFL in interceptions as a rookie back in 2022 and continues to be an impact player for the Seahawks. While Woolen does come with some attitude concerns that have been on display recently, there's no denying his talent on the field at cornerback. If Green Bay is willing to take a chance on him, Woolen could potentially be one of the top targets in this free agency class.

Jaylen Watson - Los Angeles Rams
Watson had an impressive rookie season last year and showed that he has what it takes to play at a high level in the NFL despite being undersized for the position at only 5'9", 183 pounds. He finished with solid numbers across the board, including yards per coverage snap allowed and passer rating allowed against him. While Watson may be on the smaller side compared to some of his peers at cornerback, he has shown that he can hold his own in coverage and make plays when they count most.

These are just a few examples of younger corners who could potentially be available for teams like Green Bay this offseason. Of course, there's no guarantee any of these players will actually hit the open market since many top free agents tend to re-sign with their current team at the last minute. However, if the Packers do have some cap space or can creatively manage it well enough to make a move on cornerback, one of these talented young players could potentially be the answer they're looking for in terms of improving their secondary and defense overall.
