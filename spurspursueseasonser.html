Here's my take on how the Spurs are in position to clinch the season series with a win over the Lakers tonight:

The San Antonio Spurs have been grinding out wins all year long under the steady leadership of Gregg Popovich, just like I've been calling games for 20 years now - one whistle at a time. And tonight they're in position to clinch their third straight season series victory against the Los Angeles Lakers with a win over LeBron James and company.

This isn't going to be an easy matchup though. The Lakers are hungry, led by that future Hall of Famer LeBron who is always putting on a show out there on the court - it's like watching an Avengers movie every night! But I'm telling you, the Spurs have the edge tonight. They've been playing lights-out basketball as of late and their defense will be key in shutting down the Lakers' high-powered offense.

Kawhi Leonard is going to be the star for San Antonio here. He's been hitting shots like they're nothing recently - maybe he should take a page out of Don Hutson's playbook! Kawhi has that same kind of killer instinct that made Don one of the greatest receivers ever in the NFL, even if he's doing it with his hands instead of his feet. Leonard will need to be at his best tonight.

For the Lakers, they'll have to lean on LeBron and Russell Westbrook to carry them down the stretch. Those two are like a dynamic duo - kind of reminds me of my own kids, always working together as a team. But even with those two going off for 50 points combined, I don't think it's enough to beat the Spurs' suffocating defense tonight.

This game has series implications and both teams will be leaving it all out on the court - just like I do when I'm in there calling every whistle as a ref. It should be an epic showdown that reminds me of some of those classic Packers games, especially the Instant Replay Game against the Bears back in '89 where Majkowski hit Sharpe for the game-winning touchdown!

In the end though, I've got to go with my gut and say the Spurs are going to pull this one out. They're too well-coached and they've been playing lights-out basketball as of late. The Lakers will be a tough matchup but San Antonio's defense is just on another level right now - maybe even Hall of Fame levels like Don Hutson himself!

So get ready for an epic showdown tonight between the Spurs and Lakers, it's going to be one for the ages that will have us talking about this for years down the line. And if you're looking to make some bets on it? Well let me tell ya - I'm a cold-blooded Sharp bettor who knows how to spot value in these games, just like I know when a foul is a foul out there calling games!
