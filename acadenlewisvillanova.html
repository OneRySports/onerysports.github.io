Lewis is one of the top players in college basketball this season, and he's been instrumental in helping his team get off to an 18-4 start. The sophomore guard is averaging nearly 20 points per game while shooting over 50% from the field, including more than 39% from three-point range.

Lewis has shown that he can score at all three levels and has been a consistent threat for the Wildcats on both ends of the floor. His ability to create his own shot off the dribble and knock down open looks from downtown makes him nearly impossible to guard one-on-one. Lewis' scoring has helped take some pressure off of senior guard Collin Gillespie, who has had an up-and-down season himself due to injury concerns.

While Marquette is a talented team led by sophomore center Tyler Kolek, I think Villanova should be favored in this matchup given how well they've been playing lately. The Wildcats have won four straight games entering the week and look like they're hitting their stride at just the right time. Lewis has been especially hot over that stretch, averaging better than 24 points per game while shooting nearly 57% from the field.

This Marquette game could really set the tone for where these two teams are heading in March. A win here would give Villanova a big boost of confidence coming out of conference play and into the NCAA Tournament selection process. It's still early, but Lewis is playing like an absolute star right now and it will be fun to watch him take on one of his toughest tests of the season against the Golden Eagles. If he continues this torrid pace of scoring, Villanova should come away with a victory in Milwaukee.
