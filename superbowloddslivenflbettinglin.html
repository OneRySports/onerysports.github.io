Another NFL season in the books and now we shift gears to Super Bowl odds. It’s a fascinating time as lines shift daily based on performance and public sentiment. Covers.com always has my back with live betting lines & futures tracker – I’m glued every day like clockwork! So let me break down these early SB odds, along with some sharp analysis.

Right now it's the Eagles at -800 to win it all, followed by the Chiefs at +550. That’s a massive gap between those two teams and it tells you everything about how they’re being perceived coming into next season. The Eagles are the favorite for good reason – they have an incredible roster that was built to win championships. They have talent everywhere from QB to RB to WR, plus a defense that can make life miserable for opposing QBs.
The Chiefs are also very talented, but their window of opportunity may be closing faster than people realize. Mahomes is still elite but age and wear-and-tear will catch up with him eventually; same goes for some key pieces on both sides of the ball (e.g., Travis Kelce). That said, if they get hot early and carry that momentum into January then anything can happen in the playoffs – even against Philly!

The rest of the field looks wide open though which is where I like to play. The 49ers (+650) or Patriots (+700) could surprise everyone next year while teams like the Bengals, Texans, Jets and Ravens all have upside if they make one or two key additions during free agency or draft day.

Now let’s talk about my "Ry-Guy's Betting Lock" pick! I’m going with the Eagles to cover their spread in Week 17 against the Cowboys (-3). Why? Simple – Philly has been playing lights out since Christmas Day and they need this win more than Dallas does (they clinched homefield advantage already). Plus, Dak Prescott hasn’t been himself all season long while Jalen Hurts continues to take his game to another level week after week. That’s why I’m betting the Eagles by 3 or more points in what should be an exciting shootout on Foxboro turf!

Spread Analysis:
When analyzing spreads for Super Bowl odds, there are several things I consider first and foremost – team performance relative to their opponent (especially when looking at matchups), public sentiment regarding each side of the bet, and overall market trends. For example, if a favorite is getting too much love from oddsmakers then they might be overvalued compared to other bets available; similarly, if an underdog has strong momentum heading into playoffs or postseason contention then they could offer better value than expected.

Another factor I take into account when evaluating spreads is historical data – how often do teams cover their numbers? Have certain styles of play been successful against specific opponents in past meetings? By cross-referencing all this information together, it becomes easier to identify which sides represent the best possible bets on offer at any given time.

In conclusion, while we wait for training camps and regular season games to begin, keep an eye out for those early Super Bowl odds changes because they can often tell you who is hot or cold right now – especially if there’s been a change in coaching staffs since last year (like with the Jets under Robert Saleh). As always though, don’t forget about my "Ry-Guy's Betting Lock" picks throughout 2023 NFL season!
