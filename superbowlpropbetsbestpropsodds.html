With both teams coming into this one with high expectations, I’ve been doing my research and looking at all the numbers to give you the best possible advice on how to approach your prop bets.

One thing I love about these types of bets is that they give us a chance to look at the game from a different perspective – not just who’s going to win or lose by how many points, but also specific individual performances and unique situations that could arise during the course of the game. And let me tell you, there are some really interesting props out there this year!

From things like “How many times will Tom Brady get sacked?” to “Will Rob Gronkowski catch a touchdown pass?”, we’ve got all kinds of options to choose from here. But as with any bet, it’s important that we do our homework and make sure we’re making informed decisions based on the numbers and trends before putting down any hard-earned cash.

That’s why I wanted to take some time today to break down my top prop picks for this year’s Super Bowl. After crunching all the data from past games, studying each team’s tendencies, and looking at individual player performance stats, I’ve come up with a few props that look particularly appealing based on what we know right now.

First up is a simple but effective prop – “Over/Under 2.5 passing touchdowns by Patrick Mahomes.” Now, I’m not going to lie; this might seem like an odd choice given how explosive the Chiefs’ offense can be when things are going well for them. But here’s where things get interesting: despite having one of the most dynamic offenses in football, Kansas City has actually struggled somewhat with consistency on that front over their past few games heading into the big game.

In fact, if you look at their last three contests before the playoffs started (against Tennessee Titans), Mahomes only threw for two total touchdowns while also throwing multiple interceptions along the way – something he hasn’t really done much of throughout his career up until this point. So while I’m not saying that he’s suddenly become prone to turnovers or anything like that, it does raise questions about whether or not he can maintain consistency against what should be a very stout defense from New England in this one.

But here's the thing: despite those struggles late in the season, there are still plenty of reasons to believe that Mahomes and company will come out firing on all cylinders when they take the field for the Super Bowl. For starters, let’s remember that even though he didn’t throw many touchdowns down the stretch run earlier this year, he still managed to average over 300 passing yards per game while also completing nearly two-thirds of his attempts along the way – numbers that are indicative of an elite quarterback playing at a high level overall.

Furthermore, if we take into account all the weapons around him on offense (including Travis Kelce and Tyreek Hill), it’s hard to imagine any defense in football being able to stop them for four full quarters without giving up some big plays along the way. And as far as New England goes? While they’ve got one of the best defenses in football, history has shown us time and again that Bill Belichick’s crew tends to get a little overmatched when faced with truly elite offensive units – something we saw firsthand during their playoff matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles earlier this year.

So while I’m not necessarily expecting Mahomes to throw for four touchdowns or anything like that, I do think he’ll find ways to make big plays here and there throughout the game – especially considering how much pressure he’s going to be under from New England’s defense. And given that props often have relatively low totals attached to them (like this one does), even a couple of big throws could push things over 2.5 touchdowns pretty easily if everything breaks right for Kansas City on Sunday night!

Another prop I like in this game is “Over/Under 100.5 passing yards by Tom Brady.” Now, at first glance, you might think that’s an easy choice considering how often Brady tends to throw for over 300 yards per game and has done so regularly throughout his career up until now – including during last week’s divisional playoff win over Tennessee Titans where he threw three touchdown passes while only turning it over once.

But here’s the thing: despite having one of the most prolific offenses in football, Brady’s numbers have actually been trending downward slightly as of late when compared to previous years (though still well above average overall). In fact, if you look at his past five contests prior to the playoffs starting earlier this year, he averaged just under 280 yards passing per game while completing less than 65% of his attempts and throwing multiple interceptions along the way – something that’s not entirely uncommon for him given how many passes he attempts each week.

However, even with those slight dips in production over recent weeks, there are still plenty of reasons to believe that Brady will be able to move the ball effectively against Kansas City’s secondary here on Sunday night (especially considering how much attention they’ll likely have to pay towards stopping Mahomes). And given his ability to make plays out of nothing and stretch drives late into the fourth quarter when needed, it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he finds ways to get over 100 yards passing by halftime alone!

So while I’m not expecting him to put up another 400-yard performance like we saw in Week 6 against Miami Dolphins last season (where he threw for four touchdowns and zero interceptions), I do think Brady will be able to find some success throwing the ball here and there throughout this game – especially considering how much ground he’ll need to make up if New England falls behind early on. And given that props like these often have relatively low totals attached to them (like this one does), even a couple of big throws could push things over 100 yards passing pretty easily if everything breaks right for the Patriots on Sunday night!

In summary, while there’s no guarantee with any prop bet – especially at the Super Bowl level where anything can happen from play-to-play and even down-to-down within each quarter itself (not to mention weather conditions or injuries that could affect outcomes) – I still feel pretty confident about these two picks based on what we know right now. Both Mahomes and Brady are proven winners who have shown time and again over their respective careers that they’re capable of making all kinds of plays when the chips are down, so while betting against either one might seem tempting given certain trends or tendencies that exist within each offense/defense combination here today – I think it pays off in spades to look for value elsewhere where possible.

So if you’re looking for some solid prop bets on Sunday night’s big game between Kansas City Chiefs vs New England Patriots, keep an eye out for these two props in particular: Over 2.5 passing touchdowns by Patrick Mahomes and Over 100.5 passing yards by Tom Brady – both of which offer great value based on the numbers we’ve seen so far this season leading up to Week 4 playoffs!
