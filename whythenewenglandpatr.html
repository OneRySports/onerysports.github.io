The New England Patriots may have taken a brutal L this past weekend, but don't count them out just yet. Like a controversial foul call that gets overturned on review, I believe there's still hope for Bill Belichick and company to hoist Lombardi Trophy No. 7. 

Let me break it down like a play-by-play announcer:

First off, the Patriots are no strangers to adversity. They've overcome countless injuries, tough losses, and close calls over their dynasty years. Remember when Tom Brady broke his leg in 2008? Or when they lost Rob Gronkowski for most of 2014? Yet they still found a way to win Super Bowls both seasons. That's the power of Belichick's system - it adapts and finds ways to win even with holes on the roster.

Second, Mac Jones showed flashes in his first start that he could be the long-term answer at QB. Sure, he made some rookie mistakes against a tough Bills defense, but you can't forget he was leading New England to a 4-game winning streak before this loss. With more experience and a full offseason to learn Belichick's offense, Jones has the potential to turn into another Brady or Drew Bledsoe - two guys who overcame their own early struggles in NE.

Third, I think the Patriots made a smart move bringing back James White as a free agent this offseason. He brings veteran leadership and reliability at running back, plus he's one of the best pass-catching backs in the league. Reminds me of the trade the Bucks made back in 2003 when they got Gary Payton from Seattle for Ray Allen - sometimes you have to make bold moves to get what you need. 

Fourth, I have a good feeling about rookie WR Jakobi Meyers. He's got big-play ability and could emerge as a difference-maker this season if he stays healthy. Kind of like how J.J. Watt came out of nowhere in 2012 to become the Defensive Player of the Year for Houston - sometimes you just never know until they're on the field.

Fifth, let's not forget that the Patriots still have one of the most disciplined and smartest defenses in football. Even without Trey Flowers, I think their scheme is sound enough to keep them competitive every week. They've got guys like Devin McCourty, Kyle Van Noy, and Matthew Judon who can make plays all over the field. That kind of talent and experience will go a long way when you need it most down the stretch.

So while this loss stings right now, I still believe in the Patriots' ability to bounce back and get back to the Super Bowl. They've done it before time and again - why not one more time? Like that epic Fog Bowl game between the Packers and Bears where they played through near-zero visibility - sometimes you just have to keep playing until the final buzzer even when the odds are against you. 

If I were a betting man, which I am, I'd put some money on NE making it back to the big dance this year. The pieces are there for them to do something special again if they can stay healthy and focused all season long. As Belichick likes to say - "We'll see what happens." But from where I'm sitting in Mukwonago, WI, I'm feeling optimistic about the Patriots' chances of hoisting another Lombardi Trophy before this season is over. Let's go Pats!
