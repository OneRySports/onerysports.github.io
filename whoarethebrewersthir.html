The Milwaukee Brewers are suddenly in a bit of a pickle at third base, thanks to Monday’s trade with the Boston Red Sox that sent away their top three candidates for the hot corner—Caleb Durbin, Anthony Siegler, and Oliver Dunn. This leaves the Crew scrambling to figure out who will man a position that saw *seven different players* last season. If this sounds like an Abbott & Costello sketch (“Who’s on first?!”), well… welcome to Brewers infield roulette.  

Here are the leading candidates (and one longshot) to fill Durbin’s cleats:  

---

### **1. Jett Williams**  
The Brewers’ newest acquisition from the Freddy Peralta trade, Williams is a Swiss Army knife of versatility—shortstop, second base, outfield, and now *third*? He’ll get reps at the hot corner in spring training after Matt Arnold confirmed his “busy” schedule. While he’s not a defensive wizard like Joey Ortiz (a priority for Milwaukee), his power (17 homers last year) makes him more than just a plug-and-play utility guy. The Brewers invested big for Peralta, so they’ll give Williams every chance to make an impact—even if it means moving him off shortstop.  

---

### **2. David Hamilton**  
The lone infielder returning from the trade (via waiver claims), Hamilton is a career utility man with 91 MLB games under his belt. He’s spent most of his time at shortstop and second base, but Arnold says he’ll get reps at third as well. His speed could help, but don’t expect fireworks—he’s got just one inning at the hot corner in his entire career (tiny! like Nyjer Morgan’s live-TV rant after the 2011 NLDS… *that* kind of “small”). Still, with no other infielders on the 40-man roster outside of Turang and Ortiz, he’s a stopgap who’ll try to keep his offense humming.  

---

### **3. Joey Ortiz**  
Ortiz is a wild card here. The Brewers’ defensive MVP last year at third base (and shortstop), he’d love to stay in the middle infield… but if they move him back, it forces other questions: Does Willy Adames stick at SS? Could Jett Williams challenge Turang for second base? Ortiz’s bat has improved, but his 2024 power surge makes him a viable third baseman. The Brewers are “open to permutations,” so get ready for some infield gymnastics.  

---

### **Longshots**  
- **Eddys Leonard**: A non-roster invitee with 700+ minor-league innings at third and 20 homers last year in Triple-A. If he crushes spring training, he could force his way into the mix.  
- **Brock Wilken**: A former first-round pick sidelined by a knee injury last season. His long-term upside is high (think: future Brewers’ third baseman), but he’s likely starting in Triple-A.  

---

### **External Option**  
The name everyone’s buzzing about? **Isaac Paredes**. The Astros are shopping their infield glut, and Paredes—who has one year left on his $9.3MM contract—is a power bat with 24 homers in 2024. Defensively, he’s not elite (a concern for Milwaukee), but he’d solve the Brewers’ “no pop” problem at third base. The trade would require pitching prospects (the Crew has plenty now!) and could be a bridge to Wilken or Leonard down the line.  

---

**Verdict**: This is a mess, but also an opportunity. Williams looks like the most likely Opening Day starter if he’s ready by spring training. Ortiz moving back to third could stabilize things short-term, while Paredes would be a splashy (but pricey) upgrade. Either way, the Brewers are betting on youth and versatility—a far cry from the days of drafting serial killers or cursing on live TV… but hey, at least we’re not watching Randall Woodfield try to block shots anymore.  

*Who’s playing third? We’ll know after spring training—if anyone can figure it out.* 🎯
