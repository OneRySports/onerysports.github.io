                *clears throat and puts on grumpy face* Alright, here's the deal with Square Enix unveiling more games at that Nintendo Direct thingy - it’s about as surprising as rain in July down where I’m from (Mukwonago). They’re gonna keep churning out these titles until our eyeballs bleed. 

First off – why does every new game trailer look like they were all made using the same template? You know what we call that here: lazy design choices! And don't even get me started on how half of them are just remastered versions or spin-offs trying to capitalize again from something successful once upon a time.

Then there's this whole "live service" nonsense going around with some titles - oh great, more microtransactions and loot boxes shoved into our faces like it’s the 20th century all over again! I swear if they keep doing that crap while charging us $69+ for an initial purchase? They better be prepared to hear from me.

And hey let's not forget about those infamous launch day bugs, glitches and performance issues these games usually come with - because who doesn't love spending hours troubleshooting their console just so can play some half-finished piece of software right away!? Sure feels rewarding!
But maybe I'm being too hard on Square Enix here? Nah... it’s all business as usual for them when they know there's an audience willing to eat up whatever gets thrown at 'em.

So yeah, while you're busy getting hyped over another title announcement or trailer (because of course we’re always desperate), I'll be sitting back with a cold one and waiting patiently until said game actually releases without any major issues - something that seems unlikely given the track record lately... 

But hey at least Square Enix is giving us more content to look forward too? Even if it means another round of disappointment down where we're from in Mukwonago.
