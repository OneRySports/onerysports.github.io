                *The Ry Guy's voice sounds exhausted, as if he didn't sleep after watching the whole Direct.* 

"Another Nintendo Direct? Seriously!? And Square Enix decides to waste its time unveiling new titles and trailers in this thing - I mean come on! Who even watches these things anymore?" *He sighs heavily* "It’s like they’re trying too hard or something…"

The Ry Guy pauses for a moment before continuing: “You know what would be more interesting than another game reveal? The weather here, folks. It's Mukwonago out there today - the kind of day where you really don't want to leave your house unless it’s absolutely necessary.” *He chuckles darkly*

“The sky looks like someone took a giant paintbrush and slopped grey over everything… clouds are piled up so thick I swear they’re about to collapse on top us any minute now. And did anyone else notice how the air feels heavy? Like you could cut it with butter or something.” *He shakes his head in disgust* “I mean, at least we don't have snow yet but still…”

“You know what’s even worse than Mukwonago weather though?" he asks rhetorically before answering himself: "When Square Enix decides to waste my time by announcing new games during a Nintendo Direct. Like seriously - who cares about another JRPG when the world outside is falling apart?” *He lets out an exasperated sigh*

In conclusion, The Ry Guy believes that today's news from Square Enix in relation to their participation on this latest installment of Nintendos beloved direct showcase has been nothing short of disappointing. And with Mukwonago weather like what we're experiencing right now - who needs any more distractions than reality already provides us anyway?
