            *sips coffee while reading the article with an eye roll* Here we go again... another "innovative" plan from our beloved pro leagues to squeeze every last penny out of us suckers who still pay attention when there aren't even games being played! 

Global markets, non-game days offering opportunity? Sounds like just more empty promises and marketing doublespeak designed by suits in boardrooms far away. Like they're gonna find a new way to charge me for the privilege of watching the Packers lose on Christmas Day again this year - mark my words it's already happening somewhere I'm too dumb to see!

Don't get me wrong, these sports organizations are masters at milking their fans dry with ridiculous price hikes and outlandish merchandise. But now they want us glued to screens even when there isn't a game going on? That is the real sign of desperation from an industry that can barely keep up with changing times as it stands! 

I'm not saying I don't enjoy watching sports, but come ON - trying to convince me non-game days are "opportunities" instead of just what they are: time for players and fans alike to take a breath. Next thing you know these clowns will be charging us admission fees or subscription costs every single day whether there is action on the field/court/ice/rink/track/stage/etc., not that I'd pay it anyway!

So go ahead, keep spinning your stories about how pro sports are gonna conquer new markets and make money hand over fist while we're all sitting at home bored out of our skulls. But don't be surprised if the only thing these "innovative" plans really accomplish is making people like me even more cynical than I already am! And that's saying something in this part of Wisconsin where everyone knows deep down nothing ever changes - not for better or worse, just status quo with extra salt on top.*

*sips coffee and lets out a long sigh as he flops back into his chair staring at the ceiling fan above him spinning round-and-round...just like life these days in this neck of the woods where even our beloved Green Bay Packers can't save us from mediocrity!
