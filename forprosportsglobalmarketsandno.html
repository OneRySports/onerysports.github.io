            *Sigh*. Another day in the office, another article about how pro teams can make even more money from their fans on non-game days by exploiting global markets and charging outrageous prices for souvenirs they don't need to survive but want anyway because you're desperate enough not just buy something stupidly expensive when someone told your brain that it is 'collectible'. It's like watching paint dry while also listening simultaneously 24/7 ads about how amazing this stuff will make every single aspect of life better somehow – which isn’t true either way.

The thing with these "opportunities" for sports franchises, though? They’re not exactly rocket science if you think long and hard enough at them; there’s always an opportunity unless someone decides it doesn't suit their agenda because they want something else instead (like maybe winning games or being competitive). And I know what people are thinking: *What about those poor fans who just wanna watch some basketball without feeling like beggars asking for scraps?* Well, buddy… welcome to the club of "people realizing that sports teams don't care much anymore."

This isn’t limited solely either – take our beloved Packers here in Wisconsin where green-and-gold merchandise sells faster than beer during tailgating season. But hey! At least we’re not getting sold out by some corporate entity trying desperately hard to monetize every single aspect of life (including air and water), right?

In conclusion: If you love your team enough, then go ahead purchase anything associated with them – after all, isn't that what being a fan is supposed mean nowadays anyway??
