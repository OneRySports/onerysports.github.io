The biggest move was the trade of closer Devin Williams to the New York Yankees for Nestor Cortes and Caleb Durbin. This trade will undoubtedly be one of the most talked about transactions of the winter, as the Brewers gave up their ace reliever in exchange for a young pitcher with promise and an infielder with some upside.

The acquisition of Nestor Cortes is particularly noteworthy, as he has been known to pitch well against left-handed hitters. This will be important for the Brewers’ pitching staff, which struggled at times last season when facing opposing lefties. The addition of Caleb Durbin also adds depth to the infield and could potentially fill a void created by Willy Adames’ free agency.

In other transactions, the Brewers signed Grant Wolfram as a free agent in December 2024 and later traded him for Daz Cameron on April 7th, 2025. This move shows that the team is willing to make changes even if it means parting ways with players they recently acquired.

Another interesting trade was the acquisition of Akil Baddoo from the Detroit Tigers in December 2024. Baddoo has been known for his speed and ability to hit for average, which should help solidify the Brewers’ outfield. The team also claimed Drew Avans off waivers from the Athletics on June 8th, 2025, but he was quickly optioned down after being added to their roster.

As far as pitching goes, there have been several changes with relievers coming and going throughout this past season. On May 26th, DL Hall was reinstated from the IL while Logan Henderson was optioned back down to Triple-A Nashville. Later on June 1st, Jose Quintana returned from his own injury stint while Tyler Alexander was designated for assignment in order to open up a spot on their roster when they signed Elvin Rodriguez as a free agent.

Overall, these moves show that the Brewers are committed to making changes in an effort to improve their chances of winning games this upcoming season. With new faces coming into both the starting rotation and bullpen, it will be interesting to see how these players perform under pressure during crucial moments throughout the year ahead.
