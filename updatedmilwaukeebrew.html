One of the most notable trades was the deal that sent Devin Williams to the New York Yankees for Nestor Cortes and Caleb Durbin. This trade will certainly impact the team’s pitching staff next season, as Williams has been a dominant closer over the past few years. Another trade that stood out was the acquisition of Ángel Zerpa from the Kansas City Royals in exchange for Nick Mears and Isaac Collins. Zerpa is known for his ability to get ground balls and could provide some much-needed depth in the bullpen.

In addition to these trades, the Brewers have also signed a few free agents who should help bolster their lineup next season. One of those signings was Akil Baddoo, an outfielder with experience playing for both Detroit Tigers and Minnesota Twins organizations since he was drafted by them back in 2015 (he missed part of his rookie campaign due to injury). He brings speed on the basepaths along with versatility defensively; he can play all three outfield positions if needed.

The team has also made some moves within their own organization, including purchasing Connor Thomas’ contract from St Louis Cardinals in Rule 5 Draft which means they’ll have to keep him on their active roster or put him back through waivers before opening day. They’ve also added Logan Henderson and Chad Patrick to the 40-man roster after selecting them both out of Triple-A Nashville.

As for players who will not be returning next season, several key contributors from last year’s squad have elected free agency including Joe Ross (who started 15 games), Wade Miley (26 starts) and Willy Adames (the team's shortstop). While these departures may hurt the team initially, it also creates opportunities for younger players like Tyler Black or Joey Ortiz to step up and fill those roles.

Overall, while there are some question marks surrounding where certain pieces will fit into the lineup next season given how many changes were made over the course of this past off-season, one thing remains clear: The Milwaukee Brewers organization continues to show commitment towards building a competitive ball club by making smart moves both inside and outside their farm system.
