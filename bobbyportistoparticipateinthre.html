Let me tell you about the latest development that has everyone buzzing around Milwaukee - Bobby Portis is set to participate in this season’s three-point contest at All-Star Weekend. This is a big deal for Portis and the Bucks organization alike as it marks his first time ever taking part in an All-Star event during his 11-year career!

Not only will Portis be representing the Bucks, but he's having one of his best seasons shooting from behind the arc, hitting 45.1% on 4.3 attempts per game. That mark puts him in a virtual three-way tie for fifth place in 3P% with Sam Merrill and Ayo Dosunmu - impressive numbers indeed!

Even our old friend Damian Lillard is making his return to the event after not playing at all this season due to a torn Achilles. He's looking to add another three-point title to his extensive resume, having won back-to-back competitions in 2023 and 2024 (the latter while with the Bucks). So it looks like we'll have quite a showdown between these two great shooters!

The NBA explained how the event works: "In the two-round contest, players attempt to score as many points as possible from multiple 3-point locations within 70 seconds. The top three scorers from the first round advance to the championship round, where the highest score determines the winner." We can expect some intense competition between Portis, Lillard and other talented shooters such as Donovan Mitchell, Tyrese Maxey, Jamal Murray, Norman Powell, Devin Booker, and Kon Knueppel.

So mark your calendars for next Saturday at 4:00 p.m. Central time on NBC and Peacock - this is an event you won't want to miss!

Ry-Guy's Betting Lock
As far as betting goes, it's hard to predict who will come out on top in these types of events since they can be incredibly unpredictable. However, one thing we know for sure is that both Portis and Lillard are capable of putting up big numbers from beyond the arc - making them strong contenders to watch closely.

That being said, if I had to place my money somewhere (and let's face it, who doesn't love a little friendly competition), I'd say keep an eye on Devin Booker or Donovan Mitchell as potential dark horses in this contest. Both players have proven themselves capable of scoring in bunches during regular season games - so there's no reason they can't bring that same energy over to the three-point shootout stage!

Overall, while it may not directly impact your next bet on a game between two teams, watching some of basketball’s most skilled shooters compete against each other should provide plenty entertainment value regardless. And who knows? Maybe you'll even pick up some new insights into how these guys approach their craft from beyond the arc - information that could prove useful down the line when making informed betting decisions!
