Alright, sports fans, listen up: Bobby Portis is about to turn the three-point contest into a highlight reel of pure profit potential! 🔥 The Milwaukee Bucks forward will be representing Cheesehead Nation in the NBA’s ultimate shooting showdown next weekend, and let me tell you – this isn’t just a participation trophy moment. Portis is legitimately primed for a deep run, and here’s why it matters beyond the All-Star hoopla:  

**The Blueprint Behind Portis’ Breakout:**  
First off, Portis is on an absolute tear from downtown this season (45.1% on 4.3 attempts per game). That’s not just good – that’s *elite*. He’s tied for fifth in the NBA with Sam Merrill and Ayo Dosunmu, and he’s chasing down some serious Bucks history too! If you’re unfamiliar, Portis shot a blistering 47.1% from deep during his first season with Milwaukee back in ’21-’22. Now? He’s on pace to potentially match or even eclipse that mark – which means this isn’t just about showing up for the All-Star fun. This is Portis proving he belongs among the league’s elite marksmen!  

But wait, there’s more: Portis has been locked in from deep *consistently* all year long. He’s not just a hot streak – he’s a reliable sharpshooter who can deliver when it counts most (looking at you, Bucks playoff run!). His accuracy is backed up by sheer volume too – 4.3 attempts per game means he’s not afraid to pull the trigger in crunch time. That kind of confidence and consistency will carry over big-time during the contest.  

**The Ry-Guy’s Betting Lock: Portis to Outscore Dame!**  
Here’s where it gets juicy: we’ve got another Bucks legend, Damian Lillard, back in action for this event too! The “Beard” won back-to-back titles in ’23 and ’24 (with the latter coming while he was still rocking a Bucks jersey). Now, after sitting out the entire season due to his Achilles injury? Dame’s got some serious motivation to add another championship ring to his resume.  

But here’s the kicker: while Lillard is undoubtedly one of the best three-point shooters in NBA history (and I mean it – he’s a freak!), Portis has been red-hot this season and seems more primed for a deep run than Dame does. Let me explain why:  
*   **Recent Form:** Portis’ 45% clip is his second-best mark ever *behind* the aforementioned Bucks debut campaign (where he shot 47.1%). He’s hitting his shots at a high rate right now, and that confidence will carry over to All-Star Weekend. On the flip side? Lillard hasn’t played an NBA game since April of last year! Sure, he’s been shooting in practices, but it’s not the same as competing under pressure in front of millions on national TV.  
*   **Experience:** This is Portis’ first three-point contest ever – so there’s absolutely no pressure to perform for him whatsoever. He’ll be free-flowing and fearless! Dame? Well... he knows how these things go, having won twice already. But that experience could also lead to a bit of complacency or overthinking on the line if he’s not feeling 100%.  
*   **The Bucks Factor:** Milwaukee has had at least one player in this contest three straight years (Dame, Lillard and Beasley before him). There’s clearly something about shooting hoops in Wisconsin that breeds success!  

**The Verdict: Portis for the Win!**  
So what does it all mean? Simple: Bobby Portis is my sleeper pick to not only make a deep run but potentially even win this thing outright. His recent form, confidence and lack of pressure will be his secret weapons come All-Star Weekend in LA.  

As for Lillard? He’s still the favorite on paper (who could ever forget those back-to-back titles?), but I’m leaning towards Portis making some noise and potentially stealing some headlines from Dame! Either way – it’s a win for Milwaukee, which means it’s a win for Wisconsin basketball fans everywhere.  

Keep your eyes locked on NBC/Peacock at 4:00 PM Central next Saturday because this one has "highlight reel" written all over it! The Ry-Guy is predicting big things from Portis... and I’m ready to cash in on those predictions come Monday morning!
