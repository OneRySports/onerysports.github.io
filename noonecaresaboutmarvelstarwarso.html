            Well folks, it seems like the Marvel Cinematic Universe has finally met its match – that of being utterly irrelevant! According to this article from LRMonline titled "No One Cares About Marvel, Star Wars Or Pixar Anymore," we're supposed to believe these once-beloved franchises are now sitting on a digital shelf gathering dust. 

In case you've been living under the proverbial rock (or perhaps in Wisconsin where sports reign supreme), let's recap: for years people have flocked en masse to theaters and eagerly devoured their favorite characters, plots, and worlds that were masterfully crafted by these powerhouse franchises – much like how we're drawn towards Green Bay Packers games every Sunday.

Now don't get me wrong; I'm not saying there isn’t some truth in this article's claim because honestly who doesn't enjoy a good dumpster fire once-in-a-while? But when it comes right down to brass tacks, these movies have been an integral part of pop culture for years now and continue providing entertainment value on par with any Packer game.

While the author might be correct in pointing out that interest is waning among certain demographics or even suggesting alternative forms of storytelling through various mediums (yes, I'm talking about video games), there's still no denying their impact on society as a whole – just like our beloved Cheeseheads have made an indelible mark upon American sports culture.

So while this article may give off some hints at declining interest in Marvel and Pixar films among certain segments of the population (and trust me, I'd much rather talk about Aaron Rodgers throwing another touchdown pass than discussing Thanos' latest power move), one thing remains clear – these franchises have left their mark on our collective consciousness just as Wisconsin's love for football has become deeply ingrained in its identity.
