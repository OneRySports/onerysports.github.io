            *Sigh.* Another day in the newsroom and it's time for The Ry-Guy to deliver some cold hard truth about what I'm sure is "hot" right now... or something like that? Apparently there are these movies nobody cares about anymore - Marvel, Star Wars (shocker), Pixar. Let me tell you folks; this isn't exactly front-page news if they were ever anything close! 

I mean really though—what did we expect from Hollywood’s endless parade of reboots and sequels that try too hard to capture our attention? But hey at least it gives us something new (not!) every couple months so there's always an excuse for another box office numbers article.

The real story here is how quickly people get bored with all this nonsense only to move onto the next shiny thing coming down Hollywood’s pipeline because let me tell you, they don’t make em like they used too anymore… or something? Who cares! I’d rather be watching Badger football practice anyway which has more substance than any of these so-called blockbusters ever did.

But wait – isn't this just another opportunity for those same studios who are behind said films to remind us how much money their franchises have made over the years and why we should still care? Yeah, sure thing pal! I guess if there’s one good outcome from all of it is that maybe now fans can finally start getting excited about something else… anything really besides yet another superhero flick where everyone talks in quips while saving humanity every other weekend.

In conclusion folks: The world has moved on past Marvel movies and Star Wars sequels (again), which means either our taste levels have significantly risen or Hollywood needs to step it up before nobody watches any more of their stuff ever again! As for me, I'll stick with sports because even though there's no guarantee good things will happen every time - at least when they do occur you know who deserves credit rather than some committee deciding whether your favorite character should live or die based on how well the latest merchandise sells.
