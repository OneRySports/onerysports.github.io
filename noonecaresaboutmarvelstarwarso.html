            The latest news from LRMonline has left me scratching my head in disbelief – apparently nobody cares about Marvel movies anymore? Or Star Wars and Pixar films for that matter! 

What a bunch of baloney if you ask this Wisconsin sports columnist who still gets his kicks out of watching the Green Bay Packers dominate on Sunday afternoons. These Hollywood blockbusters may not be everyone's cup o' tea, but to suggest nobody cares is like saying there are no cheeseheads in Milwaukee during Lambeau Leap season! 

I mean sure - maybe some folks have had their fill of superheroes saving the day or Ewoks fighting off Stormtroopers. And let’s face it: those Pixar animations can be pretty darn sappy sometimes too, with all that “feelings” talk and whatnot. But c'mon now – you really think there aren’t legions lining up at midnight screenings just to catch the latest instalment? Pfft!

And while we're on this topic of things nobody cares about... how 'bout them Packers making another playoff appearance next year, huh folks?! Or maybe whether or not Ryan Braun will finally hit 40 home runs before he hangs it up. Because clearly those are far more important questions than some made-up movie characters and their intergalactic battles!

In conclusion: LRMonline might want to stick with what they know best (and that’s probably nothing), because when I'm done dissecting all things Packers-related over my morning coffee, these Marvel/Star Wars/Pixar debates will seem like small potatoes compared to the real issues at hand here in Wisconsin sports world.
