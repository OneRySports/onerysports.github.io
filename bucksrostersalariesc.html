This is straight up crucial info for anyone who wants to understand how Milwaukee can build their roster moving forward. 

First off, the Bucks don't have any cap room right now – they used it last summer to sign Myles Turner and Kevin Porter Jr., which means they're over the tax line but still not paying the luxury tax this season with $6.5m below that threshold. However, if every player on their roster declined their options next summer (which is highly unlikely), they could potentially create some room by renouncing those players' rights – though it wouldn't be much more than $3 million in space.

But here's where things get interesting: the Bucks project to have a bit more cap space available during the 2027 offseason when their only guaranteed contracts will be for Turner, AJ Green, Giannis Antetokounmpo (assuming he exercises his player option), Ryan Rollins, and Bobby Portis. The team could potentially have around $20 million in cap room then – which is plenty of breathing room to make some moves!

Now let's dive into exceptions: the Bucks no longer have access to either the mid-level exception or bi-annual exception since they used their room exception earlier this year, signing Porter Jr. for about $5m and leaving them with roughly $3.6 million remaining on that exception until January when it starts prorating down. They also sacrificed four trade exceptions in order to create cap space last summer – so those are gone too.

As far as luxury tax goes, the Bucks face none of the restrictions associated with being above either apron this season since they're currently $11.8m beneath the first one and $23.7m below the second. However, if they finish over the tax line again next year (which seems unlikely), it would mean Milwaukee becomes a taxpayer once more in 2026–27 – something that could lead to repeater penalties down the road if not managed properly.

Finally, let's talk about draft picks: The Bucks have control of first-round selections in 2026, 2028, and 2030 but they are all encumbered by swaps meaning those picks cannot be traded outright unless one of their own future picks is included as a swap. However, the team may trade their own first-round picks from the 2031 or 2032 NBA Drafts without any restrictions – which gives them some flexibility there!

So what does this all mean for Bucks fans? Well, it looks like we're going to be in good shape moving forward with Giannis leading the way and plenty of potential cap space available next summer. Keep an eye out on those draft picks too - who knows when they might come into play again soon enough!
