I gotta say, as someone who's been running lines and analyzing games for over 20 years now, there's a lot to unpack here when it comes to the financials of Milwaukee's squad. 

First off, no cap room is available right now - that's pretty clear. The Bucks did some fancy footwork last summer, waiving Dame Lillard among others to create space and sign Myles Turner to that four-year deal worth $108.9 million. It was a bold move, one I wouldn't have been able to make on the fly during an NBA game like some of those refs seem to do these days! 

The interesting thing is, even if all players with options in 2026 decline them (which seems unlikely), the Bucks could only create enough cap room for a $3 million player. That's nothing when you're talking about big-name free agents. So it looks like they'll be operating under this over-the-cap restriction until at least summer of '27, when Giannis and Portis have options to consider exercising. 

Speaking of which, the Bucks gave up their MLE and bi-annual exception by creating that cap room for Turner's deal. Instead, they got a room exception worth $8.8 million - not bad! They've already used some of it on Kevin Porter Jr., but there might still be around $3.6 million left to work with before January rolls around again. 

The luxury tax situation is something I'm keeping an eye on too. Right now, they're sitting about $11.8 million below the first apron and even further down at $23.7 million from hitting the second one. That means no restrictions yet - just good old-fashioned taxpayer status if they go over next year. And with their current guaranteed salaries totaling around $181.3 million, it looks like they'll be well under the tax threshold of $187.9 million for this season. 

What does that mean for us bettors? Well, it could open up some opportunities in terms of potential trades or signings down the line, especially if we see them dipping into those remaining exceptions before January hits again. And let's not forget about those draft picks - they've got firsts in '26, '28 and '30 but can't trade any due to swaps. Only 2031 and 2032 are available for deals right now. 

This whole situation reminds me a bit of when Vince Lombardi was coaching the Packers back in his day - always finding ways to stay competitive without breaking the bank, if you know what I mean! The Bucks seem to be following that same playbook with their roster moves and salary cap management. It'll be interesting to see how it all plays out as we move closer to next season's draft and free agency period. 

In any case, this article from SB Nation is definitely worth bookmarking if you're looking for a quick reference on the Bucks' financials - especially now that they've partnered up with SalarySwish for even more detailed data. As someone who's spent countless hours studying lineups and player stats during games (and betting on them too!), I appreciate having all this info at my fingertips whenever I need it!
